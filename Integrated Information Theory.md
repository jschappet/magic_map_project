# Introduction
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a theoretical framework for understanding consciousness. Developed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi, IIT posits that consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. This theory offers a quantitative measure, known as "Phi" (Î¦), which reflects the degree of integration within a system. IIT has implications not only for neuroscience but also for philosophy, artificial intelligence, and the study of consciousness itself.

# Relevance
IIT has gained significant attention in both scientific and philosophical circles. Its relevance lies in its ability to provide a formal structure for discussing consciousness and its properties. It has implications for understanding the nature of subjective experience, the distinction between conscious and non-conscious states, and the potential for consciousness in artificial systems. As research continues, IIT may also influence ethical considerations regarding the treatment of non-human entities and the development of AI.
