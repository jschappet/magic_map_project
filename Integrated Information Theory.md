# Introduction
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, proposed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi. It suggests that consciousness arises from the capacity of a system to integrate information, quantifiable by a measure called "Phi" (Î¦). IIT posits that the more integrated information a system can generate, the higher its level of consciousness. This theory not only attempts to explain subjective experience but also provides a formal structure for discussing the nature of consciousness, making it a crucial area of study in neuroscience, philosophy, and artificial intelligence.

# Relevance
Integrated Information Theory supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. By quantifying consciousness through the integration of information, IIT suggests that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes but rather an intrinsic feature of complex systems. Key contributions of IIT include the idea that consciousness exists across a spectrum, where systems with varying degrees of integrated information possess different levels of consciousness. This perspective implies that awareness and intention are not just emergent properties but active components that shape existence, influencing the interconnectedness of all conscious entities. Furthermore, IIT opens up discussions on the ethical treatment of non-human entities and the potential for consciousness in artificial systems, thereby expanding our understanding of consciousness as a universal phenomenon.
