## Introduction
Biofeedback is a technique that teaches individuals to control physiological functions by providing real-time feedback about their bodily processes. This practice is rooted in the understanding that the mind and body are interconnected, allowing individuals to gain awareness and control over functions such as heart rate, muscle tension, and brain activity. By harnessing this awareness, people can improve their health, manage stress, and enhance overall well-being.

## Relevance
Biofeedback aligns with the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. It emphasizes the role of awareness and intention in shaping our experiences and responses to the world around us. Research in biofeedback has demonstrated that individuals can influence their physiological states through focused awareness, suggesting that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a driving force that can affect physical health and emotional well-being. This perspective supports the idea that consciousness is a powerful tool for personal transformation and healing, highlighting the interconnectedness of mind, body, and environment.
