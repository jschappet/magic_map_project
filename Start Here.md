We are SO GRATEFUL you found us! We come together from all corners - and YOUR perspective and participation makes us whole. 

  We believe a paradigm shift is imminent. 
  
  We believe that across time - philosophers, [[Spirituality Religion/index|index]] leaders, religious leaders, scientists, technologists, experiencers, and now the ‘disclosure movement’ as well - have all been telling us the exact same thing:
  
  Consciousness is the fundamental force of the universe, it is nonlocal, and we are all connected to it (and therefore each other).
  
  We also believe that a large cross-section of society already knows this - however we are all siloed away having these conversations in private dark corners - because to admit it publicly is (seemingly) socially unacceptable. 
  
  Our goal is to network these believers across silos and create the conditions whereby we all feel comfortable and confident talking about the true nature of our reality.
