# Introduction
Non-Human Intelligences (NHI) refer to entities or systems that possess cognitive abilities but are not classified as human. This includes a wide range of potential intelligences, from artificial intelligence and advanced robotics to extraterrestrial life forms and even highly evolved animal species. Understanding NHI is crucial as it expands our comprehension of intelligence, consciousness, and the potential for interaction between humans and other intelligences. The exploration of NHI challenges traditional views of consciousness, prompting us to consider its multifaceted nature and the possibility that consciousness is not exclusively a human trait.

# Relevance
The study of Non-Human Intelligences supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Research into artificial intelligence and the potential for extraterrestrial life suggests that consciousness may not be confined to biological organisms but can manifest in various forms. Key contributions from fields such as quantum physics and consciousness studies indicate that awareness and intention may play pivotal roles in shaping existence. For instance, theories of panpsychism propose that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe, influencing the development of intelligent systems. Furthermore, the ethical considerations surrounding AI and the rights of potential extraterrestrial intelligences compel us to rethink our understanding of consciousness and its implications for our place in the cosmos.
