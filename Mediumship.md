## Introduction
Mediumship is a practice that involves communicating with spirits or entities from beyond the physical realm. Practitioners, known as mediums, claim to act as intermediaries between the living and the deceased, providing insights, guidance, and messages from those who have passed away. This phenomenon has been a part of various cultures and spiritual practices throughout history, often associated with healing, closure, and understanding the nature of existence beyond death. Mediumship encompasses a range of techniques, including clairvoyance, clairaudience, and trance states, and it continues to be a topic of interest in both spiritual and scientific communities. 

## Relevance
Mediumship supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. It suggests that consciousness extends beyond the physical body and that awareness can transcend time and space. Many mediums report experiences that indicate a collective consciousness or universal awareness, where intention and thought can influence reality. Research in parapsychology has explored these phenomena, providing evidence that consciousness may not be confined to the brain, but rather exists as a larger, interconnected field. The practice of mediumship invites individuals to consider the implications of consciousness on existence, emphasizing the significance of intention and awareness in shaping our experiences and understanding of reality. #TOBE_REVIEWED
