# Introduction
Hermeticism is a spiritual and philosophical tradition based primarily on the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary Hellenistic figure often associated with the Egyptian god Thoth. This tradition encompasses various aspects of mysticism, alchemy, astrology, and theurgy, aiming to explore the nature of the divine, the cosmos, and humanity's place within it. Hermetic teachings emphasize the interconnectedness of all things and the pursuit of gnosis—knowledge of the divine. Central to Hermeticism is the idea that understanding the cosmos leads to understanding oneself, reflecting a profound relationship between microcosm and macrocosm.

# Relevance
Hermeticism supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing the unity of all existence. The principle of "As above, so below" suggests that the patterns observed in the cosmos are mirrored in the human experience, indicating that consciousness is integral to the fabric of reality. Key Hermetic ideas, such as the notion of the divine mind (Nous) and the concept of the All, propose that individual awareness is a reflection of a greater universal consciousness. This interconnectedness implies that intention and awareness are not merely subjective experiences but are influential in shaping existence, aligning with modern theories in quantum physics and consciousness studies that explore the role of observer consciousness in the manifestation of reality.
