# Introduction
Process philosophy is a school of thought that emphasizes becoming and change over static being. It posits that reality is not a collection of unchanging substances but a web of interrelated processes. This philosophical perspective has roots in the works of philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and Henri Bergson, and it has implications across various fields, including metaphysics, ethics, and the philosophy of science.

# Relevance
Process philosophy is relevant in contemporary discussions about the nature of reality, the environment, and the interconnectedness of all things. It challenges traditional notions of fixed entities and encourages a dynamic understanding of existence. This perspective is increasingly important in the face of global challenges such as climate change, where understanding processes and relationships can lead to more effective solutions.
