# Introduction
Process philosophy is a school of thought that emphasizes becoming and change over static being. It posits that reality is not a collection of unchanging substances but a web of interrelated processes. This philosophical perspective has roots in the works of philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and Henri Bergson, and it has implications across various fields, including metaphysics, ethics, and the philosophy of science. Process philosophy encourages a view of consciousness that sees it as dynamic and integral to the fabric of reality, suggesting that awareness and intention are not merely byproducts of existence but essential components that shape the unfolding of life.

# Relevance
Process philosophy supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing that all existence is in a constant state of flux and interrelation. This perspective aligns with contemporary understandings in quantum physics and consciousness studies, which suggest that consciousness is not confined to individual minds but is a shared, universal phenomenon. Key contributions from process philosophers highlight that consciousness is not merely a passive observer but an active participant in shaping reality. Ideas such as Whitehead's notion of "prehension" illustrate how entities interact and influence one another, underscoring the role of awareness and intention in the evolutionary process of existence. This interconnectedness invites a holistic approach to understanding consciousness, where the boundaries between self and other dissolve, revealing a unified field of awareness that underpins all life.
