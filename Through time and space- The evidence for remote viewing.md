# Introduction

Remote viewing is a practice that involves perceiving or describing details about a distant or unseen target using extrasensory perception (ESP) or "anomalous cognition." This concept has gained attention over the years, particularly in the realms of parapsychology and military applications. The evidence supporting remote viewing includes a variety of studies and anecdotal reports that suggest the human mind may have the capacity to transcend conventional limits of time and space.

# Relevance

The significance of remote viewing extends beyond mere curiosity; it challenges our understanding of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality. As researchers continue to explore the implications of remote viewing, it raises questions about the potential for human cognition and the interconnectedness of all things. This exploration can lead to advancements in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and even quantum physics.
