# Introduction

Remote viewing is a practice that involves perceiving or describing details about a distant or unseen target using extrasensory perception (ESP) or "anomalous cognition." This concept has gained attention over the years, particularly in the realms of parapsychology and military applications. The evidence supporting remote viewing includes a variety of studies and anecdotal reports that suggest the human mind may have the capacity to transcend conventional limits of time and space. The practice has roots in various ancient traditions and has been explored in modern scientific contexts, leading to a growing body of research and interest in understanding the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

# Relevance

Remote viewing supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. This perspective posits that consciousness is not confined to individual minds but rather exists as a universal field that connects all beings. Key contributions to this understanding come from studies demonstrating that remote viewing can occur regardless of physical distance, suggesting that consciousness operates outside the constraints of time and space. Research by prominent figures like Dean Radin and Joseph McMoneagle highlights the role of intention and awareness in shaping our experiences, indicating that our thoughts and beliefs can influence the fabric of reality itself. These findings challenge traditional scientific paradigms and open new avenues for exploring the nature of existence, consciousness, and the interconnectedness of all life.
