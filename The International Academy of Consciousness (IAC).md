# Introduction
The International Academy of Consciousness (IAC) is a leading organization dedicated to the study and research of consciousness, particularly in relation to psychic phenomena and the projection of consciousness. Founded with the aim of advancing knowledge in these fields, the IAC provides a platform for individuals interested in exploring the deeper aspects of human experience. Through workshops, courses, and research initiatives, the IAC seeks to foster understanding and personal development in the realm of consciousness.

# Relevance
The study of consciousness is increasingly relevant in today's world, where individuals are beginning to recognize consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. The IAC's research into psychic phenomena and consciousness projection supports the idea that consciousness transcends physical boundaries and is integral to understanding existence. Key contributions from IAC researchers highlight how awareness and intention can influence experiences and outcomes, suggesting that our consciousness plays a vital role in shaping reality. This perspective aligns with various scientific findings that indicate consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a fundamental aspect of the universe, capable of affecting the material world.
