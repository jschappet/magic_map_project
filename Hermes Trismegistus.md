# Introduction

Hermes Trismegistus is a legendary figure who is often associated with wisdom, writing, and the divine. He is considered a syncretic blend of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. This figure is central to the tradition of Hermeticism, which encompasses a variety of philosophical, religious, and esoteric beliefs. The teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus focus on the nature of the divine, the cosmos, and the human soul, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all things. These teachings often explore the relationship between the microcosm (the individual) and the macrocosm (the universe), suggesting that understanding oneself is key to understanding the greater reality.

# Relevance

Hermeticism supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing the idea that all things are interconnected through a divine source. The teachings of Hermes Trismegistus propose that consciousness is not merely a product of the physical brain, but rather a universal principle that permeates all existence. This perspective is reflected in concepts such as the "All is Mind," which suggests that the universe is a manifestation of a divine consciousness.

Key contributions of Hermeticism include the notion that human awareness and intention can influence the material world, a concept echoed in modern quantum physics and consciousness studies. The principle of correspondence, famously summarized as "As above, so below," indicates that the patterns of the cosmos are mirrored in the individual, suggesting a deep interrelation between consciousness and the universe. These ideas resonate with contemporary discussions on the role of consciousness in shaping reality, proposing that our thoughts and intentions can impact our experiences and the world around us.
