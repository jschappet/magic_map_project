# Introduction
Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) was an English mathematician and philosopher, best known for his work in the philosophy of science and metaphysics. He is particularly recognized for his collaboration with Bertrand Russell on "Principia Mathematica" and for developing process philosophy, which emphasizes the dynamic and relational aspects of reality. Whitehead's ideas have influenced a wide range of fields, including education, theology, and ecology.

# Relevance
Whitehead's philosophy offers a framework for understanding the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of change and development. His thoughts on process and relationality challenge traditional notions of substance and static existence, making his work relevant in contemporary discussions on systems theory, environmental ethics, and holistic approaches to science and society.
