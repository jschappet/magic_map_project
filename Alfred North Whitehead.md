# Introduction
Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) was an English mathematician and philosopher, best known for his work in the philosophy of science and metaphysics. He is particularly recognized for his collaboration with Bertrand Russell on "Principia Mathematica" and for developing process philosophy, which emphasizes the dynamic and relational aspects of reality. Whitehead's ideas have influenced a wide range of fields, including education, theology, and ecology.

# Relevance
Whitehead's philosophy supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His process philosophy posits that reality is not composed of static substances but is instead a web of interrelated events and experiences. This perspective suggests that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes but is deeply embedded in the fabric of existence itself. Key contributions from Whitehead include the notion that all entities are interconnected and that the universe is a dynamic process shaped by the interactions and experiences of these entities. His ideas imply that awareness and intention are crucial in shaping the unfolding of reality, highlighting the role of consciousness in influencing the course of events and the development of the universe.
