## Introduction
Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) are profound psychological events that may occur to individuals who have come close to death or experienced a life-threatening situation. During an NDE, individuals often report vivid experiences such as feelings of peace, detachment from the body, entering a tunnel, encountering bright lights, or meeting deceased loved ones. These experiences can have a lasting impact on a person's perspective on life, death, and the nature of consciousness.

## Relevance
NDEs provide compelling evidence supporting the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected aspect of reality. Many individuals who have undergone NDEs report experiences that transcend physical existence, suggesting that consciousness may exist independently of the brain. Notable findings from NDE research indicate that awareness can persist even when physiological signs of life are absent, challenging traditional materialist views of consciousness. These experiences often include elements of profound love, interconnectedness, and a sense of purpose, reinforcing the idea that awareness and intention are integral to shaping our reality. The transformative nature of NDEs also suggests that consciousness may play a crucial role in the broader fabric of existence, influencing not only individual lives but also the collective human experience.
