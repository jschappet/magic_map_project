# Introduction
Transcendentalism is a philosophical and literary movement that emerged in the early 19th century in America. It emphasizes the inherent goodness of people and nature, advocating for self-reliance, individualism, and a deep connection to the natural world. Key figures in this movement include Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, who sought to challenge the conventional norms of society and promote a more profound spiritual understanding of existence.

# Relevance
The principles of Transcendentalism continue to resonate today, influencing various fields such as environmentalism, education, and social justice. Its emphasis on personal intuition and the importance of nature can be seen in contemporary movements advocating for sustainability and individual rights. The ideas of self-discovery and authenticity remain pertinent in a world increasingly focused on conformity and materialism.
