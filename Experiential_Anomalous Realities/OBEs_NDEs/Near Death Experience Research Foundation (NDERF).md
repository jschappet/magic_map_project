# Introduction
The Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) is dedicated to the study and documentation of near-death experiences (NDEs) and their implications for understanding consciousness, life after death, and the human experience. Founded by Dr. Jeffrey Long, NDERF aims to provide a platform for individuals to share their NDEs and for researchers to analyze and disseminate findings related to these profound experiences. NDEs often involve transformative encounters that challenge conventional views of consciousness, suggesting that awareness may transcend physical existence.

# Relevance
The study of near-death experiences supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Research into NDEs reveals consistent themes of unity, interconnectedness, and a sense of timelessness experienced by individuals who have undergone such events. These experiences often suggest that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but rather an independent entity that can exist outside of the physical body. Key findings indicate that during NDEs, individuals frequently report heightened awareness, profound insights, and a sense of purpose, which points to the idea that awareness and intention may play crucial roles in shaping existence. Such insights challenge materialistic perspectives and open up new avenues for understanding the nature of reality and human consciousness.
