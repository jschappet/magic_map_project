# Introduction
The Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) is dedicated to the study and documentation of near-death experiences (NDEs) and their implications for understanding consciousness, life after death, and the human experience. Founded by Dr. Jeffrey Long, NDERF aims to provide a platform for individuals to share their NDEs and for researchers to analyze and disseminate findings related to these profound experiences.

# Relevance
The study of near-death experiences has garnered significant interest in both scientific and spiritual communities. NDEs can provide insights into the nature of consciousness, the potential existence of an afterlife, and the psychological impacts of such experiences on individuals. NDERF plays a crucial role in collecting data from NDErs, fostering a community for discussion, and promoting further research in this fascinating field.
