# Introduction
Dr. Jeffrey Long is a prominent radiation oncologist and the founder of the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF). His extensive work in the field of near-death experiences (NDEs) has led to the cataloging of thousands of individual accounts, revealing striking similarities and patterns among these experiences. Through his research, Dr. Long aims to deepen the understanding of consciousness and the phenomenon of NDEs, contributing to both scientific inquiry and spiritual exploration.

# Relevance
The study of near-death experiences supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Dr. Long's research suggests that NDEs often reveal a continuity of consciousness beyond physical existence, indicating that awareness is not limited to the brain. Many accounts detail experiences of heightened awareness, interconnectedness with others, and a sense of purpose, suggesting that consciousness transcends the individual and plays a significant role in shaping reality. Key findings from NDERF indicate that individuals report profound transformations in their understanding of life and death, often feeling a deeper sense of connection to the universe and a greater appreciation for love and compassion. This evidence challenges materialistic views of consciousness and supports a more expansive understanding of existence, where awareness and intention may influence the fabric of reality itself.
