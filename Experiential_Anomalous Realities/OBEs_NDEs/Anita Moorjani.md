# Introduction

# Relevance
Anita Moorjani's experiences and insights support the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Her near-death experience revealed to her the profound truth that our consciousness exists beyond the physical body and that it is intrinsically linked to all beings. Moorjani emphasizes that awareness and intention are powerful forces that shape our existence, suggesting that our thoughts and beliefs can significantly influence our health and overall reality. Her message challenges the conventional understanding of illness, proposing that healing is not merely a physical process but a deeply spiritual one that arises from recognizing our shared consciousness and embracing self-love. This perspective aligns with various philosophical and scientific inquiries into the nature of consciousness, suggesting that it is not confined to the individual but is a collective experience that connects all of us.
