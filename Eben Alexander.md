## Introduction
Eben Alexander is a neurosurgeon and author known for his profound near-death experience (NDE) that transformed his understanding of consciousness and the nature of reality. His journey from a scientific perspective to a more spiritual viewpoint is encapsulated in his bestselling book, "Proof of Heaven," where he shares his experiences during a coma caused by a rare brain infection. Alexander's work challenges conventional scientific views on consciousness and has sparked discussions on the intersection of science and spirituality.

## Relevance
Eben Alexander's insights significantly support the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His near-death experience provided him with firsthand evidence that consciousness exists beyond the physical brain. Alexander suggests that awareness and intention play crucial roles in shaping our existence, as he describes encounters with a realm of unconditional love and interconnectedness during his experience. His findings challenge the materialist paradigm, proposing that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a fundamental aspect of the universe that transcends physical limitations.
