## Introduction
Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs) are phenomena where individuals report a sensation of detachment from their physical bodies, often observing themselves and their surroundings from an external perspective. These experiences can occur spontaneously or be induced through various means, such as meditation, trauma, or near-death experiences. OBEs have been a subject of fascination across cultures and have been explored in both spiritual and scientific contexts, raising questions about the nature of consciousness and the relationship between the mind and body.

## Relevance
The exploration of Out-of-Body Experiences supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. OBEs suggest that consciousness may exist independently of the physical body, challenging traditional materialistic paradigms. Key findings from research indicate that during OBEs, individuals often report heightened awareness, clarity, and a sense of connection to a greater whole. This points to the idea that consciousness is not confined to the brain or body but may be a universal phenomenon that transcends physical boundaries. Such experiences underscore the role of awareness and intention in shaping our perception of reality, suggesting that our consciousness can influence both our subjective experiences and the world around us.
