# Introduction

Non-Human Intelligence refers to the cognitive capabilities exhibited by entities that are not classified as human beings. This includes artificial intelligence, animal intelligence, and potentially extraterrestrial intelligence. Understanding non-human intelligence is crucial as it impacts various fields including technology, philosophy, and ethics. The exploration of non-human intelligence raises profound questions about the nature of consciousness, suggesting that awareness and intention may be fundamental aspects of reality that extend beyond human experience.

# Relevance

The study of non-human intelligence supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Research in animal cognition reveals that many non-human species exhibit complex behaviors that imply a form of awareness and intention, challenging traditional views of consciousness as uniquely human. For instance, studies on social animals such as elephants and dolphins demonstrate their ability to exhibit empathy and problem-solving skills, suggesting that consciousness may not be limited to human beings. Furthermore, advancements in artificial intelligence raise questions about the nature of consciousness in machines, as they increasingly mimic human-like decision-making processes. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence also prompts us to reconsider the nature of consciousness and existence, as any discovered life forms may possess entirely different forms of awareness. These findings collectively suggest that consciousness is a pervasive aspect of reality, influencing how entities interact with each other and their environments.
