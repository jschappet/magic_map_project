# Introduction

Non-Human Intelligence refers to the cognitive capabilities exhibited by entities that are not classified as human beings. This includes artificial intelligence, animal intelligence, and potentially extraterrestrial intelligence. Understanding non-human intelligence is crucial as it impacts various fields including technology, philosophy, and ethics. This document aims to explore the significance of non-human intelligence and provide resources for further exploration.
