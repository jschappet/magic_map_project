## Introduction
HeartMath Institute is a research and education organization dedicated to exploring the connection between the heart, mind, and emotions. Founded in 1991, the institute focuses on the science of heart-brain interactions and how they influence our emotional, mental, and physical well-being. Through innovative research and practical tools, HeartMath aims to enhance personal and collective coherence, promoting a more harmonious and balanced life.

## Relevance
The work of HeartMath Institute aligns with the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Their research demonstrates that the heart has its own intrinsic intelligence and plays a crucial role in our overall consciousness. Key contributions from HeartMath highlight how heart coherence—a state where the heart, mind, and emotions are in sync—can enhance our awareness and intention. This coherence not only improves individual well-being but also fosters a sense of connection with others and the environment. Their findings suggest that our emotional states can influence our physical health and the world around us, reinforcing the idea that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a vital force that shapes existence.
