## Introduction
The Transcendental Meditation Movement is a global initiative that promotes the practice of Transcendental Meditation (TM) as a means to achieve personal transformation, enhanced well-being, and greater societal harmony. Founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1950s, the movement emphasizes the simplicity and effectiveness of TM in fostering mental clarity, reducing stress, and unlocking human potential. Through its teachings and practices, the movement aims to create a more peaceful and enlightened world.

## Relevance
The Transcendental Meditation Movement supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by promoting the idea that individual awareness can transcend the limitations of the physical world. TM encourages practitioners to access a state of pure consciousness, which is seen as a universal field from which all experiences arise. Key contributions from the movement include the understanding that meditation can facilitate a deeper connection to this universal consciousness, thereby enhancing creativity, intuition, and overall well-being. Research has suggested that intention and awareness play vital roles in shaping personal experiences and the environment, reinforcing the notion that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a fundamental aspect of existence that influences reality itself.
