## Introduction
Vedanta is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, rooted in the teachings of the Upanishads. It emphasizes the ultimate reality, known as Brahman, and the relationship between the individual self (Atman) and the universal consciousness. Vedanta explores concepts of existence, consciousness, and the nature of reality, encouraging individuals to realize their true nature and achieve spiritual growth.

## Relevance
Vedanta philosophy posits that consciousness is the fundamental basis of reality, suggesting that all existence is interconnected through a universal consciousness. This perspective aligns with modern scientific findings in quantum physics, which propose that consciousness is not localized but rather a non-local phenomenon that influences the fabric of reality. Key contributions from Vedantic thinkers emphasize that awareness and intention are not merely passive observations but active participants in shaping our experiences and the universe around us. By recognizing our inherent connection to the universal consciousness, individuals can cultivate a deeper understanding of their role in existence, promoting inner peace and ethical living.
