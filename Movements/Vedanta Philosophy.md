## Introduction
Vedanta is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, rooted in the teachings of the Upanishads. It emphasizes the ultimate reality, known as Brahman, and the relationship between the individual self (Atman) and the universal consciousness. Vedanta explores concepts of existence, consciousness, and the nature of reality, encouraging individuals to realize their true nature and achieve spiritual growth.

## Relevance
Vedanta philosophy encourages recognition of consciousness as the foundation of reality. It inspires self-realization and personal growth, guiding individuals towards understanding their true selves and their connection to the universe. The teachings of Vedanta promote inner peace, ethical living, and a deeper understanding of the nature of existence, making it relevant in today's fast-paced world.
