# Introduction
Authentic Relating is a practice that emphasizes genuine connection and communication between individuals. It involves being present, vulnerable, and open in interactions, fostering deeper understanding and empathy. This approach encourages participants to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences authentically, leading to more meaningful relationships and community building.

# Relevance
