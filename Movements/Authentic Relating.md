# Introduction
Authentic Relating is a practice that emphasizes genuine connection and communication between individuals. It involves being present, vulnerable, and open in interactions, fostering deeper understanding and empathy. This approach encourages participants to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences authentically, leading to more meaningful relationships and community building. By engaging in authentic relating, individuals can explore the depths of their consciousness, recognizing the interconnectedness of their experiences and the impact of their presence on others.

# Relevance
Authentic Relating supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing the importance of awareness and intention in our interactions. This practice aligns with the idea that consciousness is not merely an individual phenomenon but a shared experience that transcends physical boundaries. Through authentic communication, individuals can tap into a collective awareness, fostering empathy and understanding that enriches the human experience. Key contributions from this practice suggest that when we engage authentically, we not only shape our own reality but also influence the consciousness of those around us, creating a ripple effect of connection and awareness that reinforces the interconnected nature of existence.
