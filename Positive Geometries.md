recent research suggests that certain types of geometry, including "positive geometries," can be discovered and studied independently of the traditional notion of space-time.Â These geometries, like the "amplituhedron," describe the behavior of quantum particles and can be understood as abstract mathematical structures that emerge from underlying phenomena, rather than being directly dependent on space-time.
