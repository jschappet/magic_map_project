# Introduction
The Parapsychological Association (PA) is a professional organization dedicated to the study of paranormal phenomena, including extrasensory perception (ESP), psychokinesis, and other related topics. Established in 1957, the PA promotes scientific research and education in the field of parapsychology and aims to foster communication among researchers, practitioners, and the general public. The organization serves as a vital platform for exploring the nature of consciousness and its potential non-local characteristics, suggesting that human awareness may extend beyond the confines of the physical brain.

# Relevance
The PA is significant in the scientific community as it supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Research in parapsychology often points to phenomena that challenge conventional understandings of space and time, suggesting that consciousness may not be limited to individual experiences but rather interconnected across a broader spectrum of existence. Key contributions from researchers affiliated with the PA have indicated that awareness and intention can shape reality, as evidenced in studies on ESP and psychokinesis. These findings encourage a re-evaluation of the nature of reality, proposing that consciousness itself may play a crucial role in the manifestation of experiences and phenomena.
