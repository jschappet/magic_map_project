# Introduction
Gnostic Christianity refers to a diverse set of early Christian beliefs and practices that emphasize personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) over orthodox teachings and institutions. Emerging in the first few centuries CE, Gnostic Christians often viewed the material world as flawed or evil, created by a lesser deity, and believed that salvation comes from transcending the material through mystical knowledge. Central to Gnostic thought is the idea that individual consciousness can connect with a higher, divine reality, offering insights into the nature of existence and the self.

# Relevance
Gnostic Christianity supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing the importance of personal spiritual experience and knowledge. Gnostic texts often suggest that awareness and intention are crucial in shaping one's reality and understanding of the divine. This perspective aligns with contemporary theories in consciousness studies that posit consciousness as a primary force in the universe, transcending the limitations of the physical world. Key contributions from Gnostic thought, such as the belief in the divine spark within each individual and the pursuit of gnosis as a means of connecting with the transcendent, highlight the interconnectedness of all beings and the potential for collective spiritual awakening.
