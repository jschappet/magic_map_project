## Introduction

The "Bubblegum Token" program is an innovative initiative designed to promote joy and recognition of positive moments within households. By encouraging families and group houses to actively acknowledge and celebrate acts of kindness, humor, and service, we aim to create a more joyful living environment. This program not only fosters connection among household members but also helps individuals develop a deeper appreciation for the small joys in everyday life.

## Relevance

In a fast-paced world where negativity can often overshadow positivity, the "Bubblegum Token" program serves as a reminder to focus on the good. By assigning intrinsic value to joyful moments, families can cultivate a culture of gratitude and appreciation. This initiative is especially relevant as mental health awareness grows, highlighting the importance of recognizing and celebrating joy as a vital component of well-being.

#TOBE_REVIEWED
are interested in chatting about it first, agreeing on the model, and then simply giving it a go for a month or two and then reporting back.

If it goes well? Let's expand the concept to more households and let them experience/shape it. If it doesn't, nothing lost other than the explicit recognition of what joy has brought you in your household, or the joy you have brought others. Oh and a tiny bit of time writing something down.

So what do you think? Any volunteers to test this out
