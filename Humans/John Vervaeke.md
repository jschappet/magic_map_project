### Summary:

> **To John Vervaeke, myth is not about believing in fantastical stories. It’s about entering a process of self-transcendence, meaning-making, and consciousness transformation.**
> 
> Myths are the symbolic operating systems that once helped humans metabolize the deepest truths of being—not as abstract ideas but as lived, enacted transformations.

### 🔍 **1. Myth as a Mode of Knowing**

Vervaeke argues that myth operates in a different cognitive register than propositional knowledge (facts and statements). It involves:

- **Participatory knowing**: Knowing by _being_ in a certain kind of relationship with the world.
    
- **Perspectival knowing**: Knowing through the lived perspective of a subject.
    
- **Procedural knowing**: Knowing _how_ to act.
    
- **Propositional knowing**: Knowing _that_ something is the case.
    

Myth integrates all of these. It doesn’t just _tell_ us truths—it _transforms_ us by engaging us in a narrative that shapes our identity, actions, and sense of reality.

### 🌀 **2. Myth and Transformation of Consciousness**

Vervaeke emphasizes that myths are not static stories; they’re dynamic processes that facilitate the transformation of consciousness. Myths help people:

- **Reframe their identity** (Who am I?),
    
- **Navigate existential crises** (What’s worth living or dying for?),
    
- **Bridge the sacred and the everyday**, by putting individuals in touch with what he calls the “transcendent,” which doesn’t necessarily mean supernatural but rather _what is most real and most transformative_.
    

So myth isn’t escapism—it’s **ecological attunement**: a way of harmonizing inner consciousness with the patterns of reality.

### 🧠 **3. The Relevance to the Meaning Crisis**

According to Vervaeke, modern Western societies are in a “meaning crisis”: we’ve lost touch with the symbolic, narrative, and mythological frameworks that once oriented human life. Our consciousness is fragmented. Myths, rituals, and wisdom traditions once provided _ways of knowing_ that helped people make sense of themselves and the world in an integrated way.

In his framework:

- Myth is a **means of “relevance realization”**—it helps us sort what's meaningful from what's not.
    
- It cultivates **insight**, especially in the form of _"gnosis"_ (experiential knowing), not just analytical understanding.
    
- It's a tool of **self-transcendence**, helping individuals undergo real psycho-spiritual development.

### 🌱 **4. Myth, Psychedelics, and Ritual**

Vervaeke often connects myth to altered states of consciousness—whether through meditation, contemplation, or psychedelic experience. In these states, myths can come alive, not as literal truths but as **symbolic maps for navigating transformations in consciousness**.

This ties into ancient traditions, where myth was always embedded in **ritual practice**, which enacted the narrative in a way that _trained attention_, _guided transformation_, and _cultivated wisdom_.
