## Introduction
Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist and author known for his controversial theory of morphic resonance. This concept suggests that all living organisms share a collective memory that influences their development and behavior. Sheldrake's work intersects both science and philosophy, challenging traditional views of biology and consciousness. His ideas propose that consciousness is not merely a product of individual brains but rather an interconnected phenomenon that transcends physical limitations.

## Relevance
Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His work suggests that consciousness is not confined to individual organisms; instead, it is part of a larger, shared field that connects all living beings. This interconnectedness implies that awareness and intention can influence not only individual behavior but also the evolution and development of species. Key contributions from Sheldrake include the idea that habits and memories of past organisms shape the behavior of current ones, indicating that consciousness is a dynamic, collective process that informs existence across time and space. This perspective encourages a deeper understanding of how consciousness interacts with the material world, suggesting that it plays a critical role in shaping reality itself.
