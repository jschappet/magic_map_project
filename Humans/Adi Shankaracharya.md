## Introduction
Adi Shankaracharya, an influential philosopher and theologian from India, is best known for consolidating the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, which emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality. He lived in the early 8th century CE and traveled extensively across the Indian subcontinent, advocating for the understanding of Brahman as the ultimate reality and the self (Atman) as non-different from it. His teachings challenge the illusion of Maya, guiding individuals towards liberation (Moksha) and the realization of their unlimited potential.

## Relevance
Shankaracharya's philosophy supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. By asserting that Atman (the individual self) is non-different from Brahman (the ultimate reality), he highlights the intrinsic unity of all existence. This perspective aligns with contemporary findings in consciousness studies, suggesting that awareness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes but a fundamental aspect of reality itself. Shankaracharya's teachings on Maya illustrate how the illusion of separateness can obscure our understanding of this interconnectedness. His emphasis on self-realization and the transformative power of awareness underscores the role of intention in shaping oneâ€™s existence, affirming that consciousness is both the observer and the observed, thus reinforcing the idea that we are all part of a singular, conscious reality.
