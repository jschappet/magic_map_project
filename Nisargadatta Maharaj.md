## Introduction
Nisargadatta Maharaj was a prominent Indian spiritual teacher and philosopher known for his teachings on non-duality and self-inquiry. Born in 1897 in Mumbai, he lived a simple life as a shopkeeper until he encountered a profound spiritual awakening. His teachings, primarily derived from the Advaita Vedanta tradition, emphasize the importance of understanding one's true self beyond the confines of the ego and the mind.

## Relevance
Nisargadatta Maharaj's teachings profoundly support the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. He posited that the true self, or "I Am," transcends individual identity and is a manifestation of universal consciousness. His dialogues reveal that awareness is not merely a passive observer but an active participant in shaping our experience of existence. Maharaj emphasized the importance of self-inquiry, encouraging seekers to look beyond the transient nature of thoughts and emotions to uncover the underlying awareness that connects all beings. This perspective aligns with contemporary findings in consciousness studies, suggesting that intention and awareness play crucial roles in the manifestation of reality, reinforcing the interconnectedness of all life.
