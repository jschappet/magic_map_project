## Introduction
Paramahansa Yogananda was a prominent Indian yogi and spiritual teacher, best known for bringing the teachings of Kriya Yoga and meditation to the West. He founded the Self-Realization Fellowship in 1920, which aims to foster a deeper understanding of the relationship between the individual soul and the Divine. His seminal work, "Autobiography of a Yogi," has inspired countless individuals to explore spiritual practices and the nature of consciousness.

## Relevance
Yogananda's teachings emphasize that consciousness is the fundamental basis of reality, suggesting that our awareness and intentions shape our experiences. He posits that through meditation and spiritual practice, individuals can transcend the limitations of the physical world and connect with a universal consciousness. His ideas align with the view that consciousness is non-local and interconnected, as he teaches that all beings are part of a greater divine essence. This perspective encourages individuals to recognize their inherent divinity and the power of intention in creating their reality, reinforcing the notion that awareness is a key component in the manifestation of existence.
