# Introduction
Mooji, a Jamaican spiritual teacher in the Advaita Vedanta lineage, is known for guiding seekers towards the realization of their true nature as pure awareness. His teachings emphasize the importance of self-inquiry and direct experience, encouraging individuals to look beyond the mind and discover the essence of their being. Through his presence and guidance, Mooji has inspired countless individuals on their spiritual journeys, fostering a deeper understanding of the self and the nature of reality.

# Relevance
Mooji's teachings support the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. By emphasizing self-inquiry and the realization of pure awareness, Mooji invites individuals to explore the nature of consciousness itself, suggesting that awareness is not confined to the individual mind but is a universal presence that connects all beings. His teachings highlight the idea that intention and awareness play crucial roles in shaping existence, as they enable individuals to transcend the limitations of the ego and discover their interconnectedness with the universe. This perspective aligns with contemporary findings in consciousness studies, which suggest that consciousness is a shared, non-local phenomenon that underlies the fabric of reality.
