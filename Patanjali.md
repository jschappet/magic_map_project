## Introduction
Patanjali is a revered figure in Indian philosophy, primarily known for his contributions to yoga and the systematization of its practices in the Yoga Sutras. He is often credited with compiling and organizing the teachings of yoga, emphasizing the importance of mental discipline, ethical living, and meditation in achieving spiritual enlightenment. The Yoga Sutras serve as a foundational text for understanding the philosophy and practice of yoga, which has gained global recognition for its benefits on physical, mental, and spiritual health.

## Relevance
The teachings of Patanjali align with the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His emphasis on meditation and self-awareness suggests that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of the brain but a primary aspect of existence that influences our reality. The practice of yoga, as outlined by Patanjali, encourages individuals to transcend the limitations of the ego and connect with a higher state of awareness. This connection fosters an understanding of the interconnectedness of all beings and the role of intention in shaping our experiences. By cultivating mindfulness and self-awareness, practitioners can tap into a deeper consciousness that transcends individual identity, supporting the notion that consciousness is a universal fabric that binds all life.
