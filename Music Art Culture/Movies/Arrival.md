## Introduction
"Arrival" is a thought-provoking science fiction film that delves into the complexities of language, time, and human experience through the story of linguist Louise Banks. Recruited by the U.S. military, Louise must decipher the language of extraterrestrial beings who have landed on Earth. The film explores the profound implications of communication and understanding, as well as the nature of human experience and perception. The narrative intertwines Louise's personal memories, particularly those involving her daughter, with broader themes that resonate deeply with the human condition.

## Relevance
"Arrival" supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by illustrating how language shapes our understanding of existence. The film posits that language is not merely a tool for communication, but a framework that influences perception and thought. As Louise learns the alien language, she begins to experience time non-linearly, suggesting that awareness and intention can transcend traditional boundaries of time and space. This aligns with the idea that consciousness is a shared experience, connecting individuals across different dimensions of reality. The film encourages viewers to reflect on the interconnectedness of all beings and the potential for collective consciousness to shape existence.
