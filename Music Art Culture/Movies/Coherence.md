## Introduction
"Coherence" is a psychological thriller that intricately weaves together themes of perception, reality, and the fragility of human relationships. Set against the backdrop of a rare astronomical event, the film invites viewers to delve into the complexities of consciousness and the impact of external phenomena on personal identity. As a group of friends gathers for a dinner party, they find themselves confronted with unsettling occurrences that challenge their understanding of reality and trust. The narrative unfolds in a way that encourages reflection on the nature of existence and the interconnectedness of human experiences.

## Relevance
"Coherence" supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by illustrating how individual perceptions can diverge and influence one another under extraordinary circumstances. The film's exploration of alternate realities suggests that awareness and intention play a crucial role in shaping existence. Key contributions include the portrayal of how shared experiences among friends can alter their understanding of self and relationships, emphasizing the idea that consciousness is not just an individual phenomenon but a collective experience that transcends physical boundaries. This aligns with contemporary theories in consciousness studies that highlight the interconnectedness of human experiences and the potential for consciousness to influence reality itself.
