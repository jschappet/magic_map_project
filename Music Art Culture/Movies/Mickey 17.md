## Introduction
In "Mickey 17," we follow the story of a disposable worker named Mickey, who is part of a futuristic colonization mission on a distant planet. Created as an expendable clone, Mickey's role is to undertake dangerous tasks that others cannot. However, when he dies during a mission, he is quickly replaced by another clone, Mickey 18. But something goes wrong, and the memories of the previous Mickeys begin to merge, leading to an existential crisis as Mickey grapples with his identity and purpose. The film explores themes of individuality, consciousness, and the ethics of cloning in a high-stakes adventure.

## Relevance
"Mickey 17" serves as a compelling narrative that supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. The merging of memories among the clones suggests that consciousness is not merely a product of individual experience but rather a shared, collective phenomenon. This portrayal raises questions about the nature of self and identity, emphasizing that awareness and intention can shape existence beyond the confines of a single physical body. The film invites viewers to consider the implications of interconnected consciousness and how it influences our understanding of what it means to be alive and human. Through its exploration of cloning and existential crises, "Mickey 17" contributes to ongoing discussions about the essence of consciousness and its role in defining reality. #TOBE_REVIEWED
