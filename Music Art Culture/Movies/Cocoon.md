## Introduction
"Cocoon" tells the story of a group of elderly residents at a Florida retirement home who discover a mysterious pool that has rejuvenating properties. When they swim in it, they regain their youth and vitality, leading to a series of adventures and newfound relationships. The film explores themes of aging, friendship, and the desire to reclaim lost youth while also introducing an extraterrestrial element that challenges the characters' understanding of life and existence. This narrative serves as a metaphor for the human experience, illustrating the longing for connection and the exploration of deeper existential questions.

## Relevance
"Cocoon" supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by illustrating how the characters' experiences with the rejuvenating pool transcend the limitations of their physical bodies. The film suggests that consciousness is not confined to the physical realm, as the elderly characters encounter a transformative experience that alters their perception of life and existence. This aligns with ideas in consciousness studies that posit awareness and intention as key factors in shaping our reality. The rejuvenation they experience can be seen as a manifestation of their collective intention to reclaim vitality and connection, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the potential for consciousness to influence the material world.
