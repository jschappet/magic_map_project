## Introduction
Vedanta is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, focusing on the study of the Upanishads, which are ancient texts that explore the nature of reality and the self. The term "Vedanta" literally means "the end of the Vedas," signifying its philosophical culmination. This school emphasizes the concept of Brahman (the ultimate reality) and Atman (the individual self), advocating for self-realization as a means to understand the interconnectedness of all existence. Various schools of thought within Vedanta interpret these concepts differently, leading to a rich tapestry of philosophical inquiry.

## Relevance
The teachings of Vedanta assert the primacy of consciousness, proposing that realizing one's true nature can unlock limitless potential. This philosophy encourages individuals to transcend the limitations of the ego and societal conditioning, fostering a deeper understanding of the self and its relationship with the universe. By engaging with Vedantic principles, practitioners can cultivate inner peace, wisdom, and a profound sense of purpose. The different schools of Vedanta—such as Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, and Dvaita—offer unique perspectives that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of existence and spirituality.
