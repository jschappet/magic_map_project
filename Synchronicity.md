## Introduction
Synchronicity is a concept introduced by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, which refers to meaningful coincidences that occur with no causal relationship, yet seem to be meaningfully related. Jung proposed that synchronicity is a principle that connects the inner psychological state of an individual with external events, suggesting that there is an underlying connection between the psyche and the external world. This idea challenges traditional notions of causality and emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things, pointing towards a more holistic understanding of consciousness.

## Relevance
The concept of synchronicity supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. It suggests that our awareness and intentions can influence and shape our experiences, highlighting the idea that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of neurological processes but rather a fundamental aspect of existence. Key contributions from Jungian psychology indicate that synchronicity can serve as a bridge between the subjective and objective realms, illustrating how our thoughts and feelings can manifest in the external world. This interconnectedness implies that consciousness transcends individual experiences, promoting a deeper understanding of reality as a unified whole where intention and awareness play crucial roles.
