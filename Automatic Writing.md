## Introduction
Automatic writing is a practice that involves writing without conscious thought, allowing the subconscious mind or higher consciousness to express itself. Often used as a tool for spiritual exploration, creative inspiration, or therapeutic purposes, automatic writing has roots in various spiritual and psychological traditions. It is believed that this technique can facilitate communication with one's inner self, spirit guides, or the collective consciousness, providing insights that may not be accessible through ordinary thinking processes.

## Relevance
The practice of automatic writing aligns with the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. It suggests that consciousness is not confined to individual minds but is a universal field from which insights and creativity can emerge. By tapping into this collective consciousness, practitioners of automatic writing often report experiences of heightened awareness and clarity, indicating that intention and awareness play crucial roles in shaping our reality. This practice supports the idea that our thoughts and intentions can influence the world around us, highlighting the interconnectedness of all beings and the potential for transformation through conscious engagement.
