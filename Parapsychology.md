# Introduction

Parapsychology is the study of phenomena that are beyond the scope of traditional scientific understanding, often referred to as "anomalous experiences." This field investigates various psychic phenomena, including telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, and near-death experiences. Parapsychologists seek to understand the nature of consciousness and its potential connections to the universe, challenging the boundaries of what is considered possible. The exploration of these phenomena raises profound questions about the nature of reality and the limits of human perception.

# Relevance

Parapsychology supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Research in this field suggests that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but rather a primary element of existence that transcends physical boundaries. Key contributions, such as Dean Radin's work on the effects of intention on random number generators and studies on telepathy, indicate that awareness and intention can influence external reality. Findings from near-death experiences also suggest a continuity of consciousness beyond physical death, reinforcing the idea that consciousness is a pervasive force in the universe. By challenging conventional scientific paradigms, parapsychology invites a reevaluation of the interconnectedness of all beings and the potential for consciousness to shape our experiences.
