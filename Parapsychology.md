# Introduction

Parapsychology is the study of phenomena that are beyond the scope of traditional scientific understanding, often referred to as "anomalous experiences." This field investigates various psychic phenomena, including telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, and near-death experiences. Parapsychologists seek to understand the nature of consciousness and its potential connections to the universe, challenging the boundaries of what is considered possible.

# Relevance

The relevance of parapsychology lies in its exploration of the human experience beyond the physical realm. As science continues to evolve, the questions surrounding consciousness, the afterlife, and unexplained phenomena remain significant. Parapsychology encourages open-mindedness and critical thinking, promoting a deeper understanding of human potential and the mysteries of existence. Its findings may have implications for psychology, spirituality, and even quantum physics, making it a fascinating area of study.
