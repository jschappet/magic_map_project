## Introduction
Channeling is a practice that involves individuals, often referred to as "channelers," communicating messages from non-physical entities, such as spirits, guides, or higher consciousness. This phenomenon has roots in various spiritual and religious traditions and has gained popularity in modern metaphysical communities. Channeling can take many forms, including spoken messages, written texts, and artistic expressions, and is often seen as a means of accessing deeper wisdom and guidance from beyond the physical realm.

## Relevance
Channeling supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by suggesting that our individual consciousness is merely a fragment of a larger, universal consciousness. The act of channeling implies that awareness and intention can transcend physical limitations, allowing individuals to tap into a collective knowledge that influences existence. Many channelers report insights that align with concepts of unity, interconnectedness, and the power of intention, reinforcing the idea that consciousness is not confined to the individual but is part of a vast, interconnected web of existence. Through channeling, practitioners often emphasize the role of love, intention, and awareness in shaping reality, suggesting that our thoughts and feelings can have a profound impact on the world around us.
