# Introduction
Adi Shankaracharya, an influential philosopher and theologian from India, is best known for consolidating the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a non-dualistic interpretation of Hindu philosophy. Born in the early 8th century CE, Shankaracharya traveled extensively across India, establishing monastic centers and revitalizing the study of the Vedas. His teachings emphasized the unity of the individual soul (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman), advocating for the realization of this oneness as the path to liberation (Moksha).

# Relevance
Adi Shankaracharya's philosophy supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His teachings on Advaita Vedanta propose that the distinction between the individual self (Atman) and the universal consciousness (Brahman) is an illusion (Maya). This notion aligns with contemporary understandings of consciousness, suggesting that individual awareness is not separate from a universal consciousness but rather a manifestation of it. Shankaracharya's emphasis on self-inquiry and realization of oneness indicates that awareness and intention are crucial in shaping our perception of existence. His work invites a deeper exploration of how consciousness underpins reality, encouraging seekers to transcend dualistic thinking and recognize the interconnectedness of all beings.
