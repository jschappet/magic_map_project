## Introduction
Glenn B. Wheaton is a retired U.S. Army Special Forces sergeant who served with the 5th Special Forces Group. Following his military career, he became known for his work in the fields of psychic phenomena and remote viewing. Wheaton's unique background and expertise have led him to explore the intersection of military operations and psychic abilities, notably through his involvement in the infamous "men who stare at goats" project, which aimed to investigate the potential of psychic abilities within military contexts. His experiences highlight the intriguing possibilities of consciousness extending beyond conventional boundaries.

## Relevance
Wheaton's exploration of remote viewing and psychic phenomena supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His work suggests that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but rather a pervasive force that transcends physical limitations. Key contributions from his experiences indicate that awareness and intention may significantly influence the fabric of existence. This perspective aligns with findings from various fields, including quantum physics and psychology, which propose that consciousness can affect reality at a distance, thereby reinforcing the interconnectedness of all beings and the universe itself. Wheaton's insights challenge traditional notions of separateness and encourage a deeper understanding of how intention can shape experiences and outcomes.
