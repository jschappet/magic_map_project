## Introduction
Nick Bostrom is a prominent philosopher and futurist known for his work on the implications of advanced technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, human enhancement, and existential risks. He is the founding director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford and has published extensively on topics related to ethics, technology, and the future of humanity. Bostrom's ideas often challenge conventional thinking about the future and our place in the universe, making him a key figure in discussions surrounding consciousness and reality.

## Relevance
Bostrom's work supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by exploring the implications of advanced technologies and their impact on human perception and existence. His ideas suggest that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of biological processes but a central element in shaping our understanding of reality. For instance, his simulation hypothesis posits that if we are living in a simulated reality, it raises profound questions about the nature of consciousness and existence itself. This aligns with theories that propose consciousness as a non-local phenomenon, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the role of awareness in influencing the fabric of reality. Bostrom's contributions encourage a deeper exploration of how intention and consciousness can shape our experiences and the future of humanity.
