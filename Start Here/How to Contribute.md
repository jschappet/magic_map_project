## What We Believe

We believe Consciousness is fundamental, non-local, and deeply interconnected. Throughout history, mystics, spiritual teachers, religious figures, scientists, and diverse experiencers have pointed to this truth. Today, technological and scientific advancements are making it increasingly undeniable. Yet, these conversations remain siloed across disciplines. We aim to bridge these gaps—creating a cross-domain network that makes it safe, natural, and compelling to bring these ideas into mainstream discourse. 

## Mapping the Network

Our first step is a collaborative mapping project: we are identifying key people, movements, ideas, organizations, and experiences that already reflect this consciousness-centered worldview. This map will serve as a foundation for connection, collaboration, and cultural shift.
