# Introduction
Panpsychism is the philosophical view that consciousness, mind, or soul is a universal feature of all things. This perspective suggests that all entities, from the smallest particles to the largest celestial bodies, possess some form of consciousness or mental states. The concept has roots in ancient philosophy and has seen a resurgence in contemporary discussions about the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem.

# Relevance
Panpsychism is increasingly relevant in various fields, including philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. As researchers explore the nature of consciousness, panpsychism offers a framework that challenges traditional views of mind as something that arises solely in complex organisms. It raises important questions about the nature of experience, the relationship between mind and matter, and the implications for ethics, particularly concerning how we treat non-human entities.
