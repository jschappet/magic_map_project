## Introduction
The Global Coherence Initiative (GCI) is a transformative project aimed at fostering collective emotional states that contribute to a more harmonious global consciousness. By harnessing the power of synchronized human intention and emotion, GCI seeks to inspire collective action toward human evolution and societal well-being. This initiative recognizes the profound interconnectedness of humanity and the potential for collective emotional coherence to influence global events positively.

## Relevance
In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, the emotional states of individuals can significantly impact collective consciousness and societal outcomes. The GCI investigates how shared emotional experiences can lead to synchronized actions that promote peace, empathy, and understanding across cultures. By engaging individuals and communities in practices that enhance emotional coherence, the initiative aims to catalyze a shift in global consciousness, fostering a more compassionate and evolved human experience.
