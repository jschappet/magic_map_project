## Introduction
The Baha’i Faith is a world religion that emphasizes the unity of all people and the oneness of humanity. Founded in the 19th century by Baha'u'llah in Persia (modern-day Iran), the faith teaches that all major religions come from the same divine source and advocates for universal justice, equality, and spiritual empowerment. Baha’is believe in the importance of global harmony and strive to create a peaceful and just society through their teachings and community actions.

## Relevance
The Baha’i Faith promotes unity, universal justice, and spiritual empowerment as pathways to the development of a harmonious and thriving global society. Its principles encourage individuals and communities to transcend divisions of race, nationality, and religion, fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute to the common good. The teachings of the Baha’i Faith provide a framework for addressing contemporary issues such as inequality, conflict, and environmental sustainability.
