As Lena and her team explore the Shimmer, they encounter strange creatures and face their own psychological struggles, ultimately confronting the nature of self-destruction and transformation. The film delves into themes of identity, grief, and the unknown, leading to a haunting and ambiguous conclusion.

It challenges viewers to reflect on their own consciousness and the impact of trauma and change on the psyche. The film's emphasis on the unknown and the unknowable also resonates with contemporary discussions in philosophy and science about the limits of human understanding.
