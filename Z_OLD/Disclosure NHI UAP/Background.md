# Core Idea
Consciousness is the fundamental force of the universe, non-local, and interconnected.

## Philosophy

### Subfields, Movements, and Schools of Thought:
•    Idealism – Reality is fundamentally mental or consciousness-based.
•    Panpsychism – Consciousness is a universal property of all things.
•    Process Philosophy – Reality is a process, and consciousness is intrinsic to it.
•    Phenomenology – Focuses on consciousness as the primary mode of experience.
•    Metaphysical Dualism & Monism – Investigates the relationship between mind and matter.
•    Transcendentalism – Emphasizes the unity of all existence through consciousness.

### Key Figures, Texts, and Groups:
•    Plato (Theory of Forms, Idealism)
•    Baruch Spinoza (Pantheism, Monism)
•    Immanuel Kant (Transcendental Idealism)
•    Alfred North Whitehead (Process Philosophy)
•    William James (Radical Empiricism, Mysticism)
•    Bernardo Kastrup (Analytic Idealism)

### Commonalities & Distinctions:
•    Many of these traditions argue that mind precedes matter.
•    Some, like Process Philosophy, integrate consciousness into an evolving reality.
•    Others, like Panpsychism, distribute consciousness across all entities.

## Spirituality & Religion

### Subfields, Movements, and Schools of Thought:
•    Non-Duality (Advaita Vedanta, Dzogchen, Sufism, Taoism, Kabbalah, Gnostic Christianity)
•    Mysticism (Christian, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Indigenous Traditions)
•    Esoteric Christianity (Gnostic, Hermetic, Theosophy, Anthroposophy)
•    Indigenous & Shamanic Traditions (Animism, Dreamtime, Sacred Plants & Visionary States)

### Key Figures, Texts, and Groups:
•    [[Adi Shankaracharya]] (Advaita Vedanta, Non-duality)
•    [[Rumi]] (Sufi Mysticism)
•    [[Laozi]] (Taoism, The Dao as Universal Consciousness)
•    Meister Eckhart (Christian Mysticism)
•    Sri Aurobindo (Integral Yoga, Conscious Evolution)
•    The Upanishads (Hindu texts on Brahman and Atman)
•    The Gospel of Thomas (Gnostic Christianity)

### Commonalities & Distinctions:
•    Many of these traditions propose an all-pervading universal consciousness.
•    Some, like Advaita Vedanta and Sufism, emphasize direct experience of unity.
•    Indigenous and shamanic traditions often emphasize nature-based, interconnected consciousness.
## Science

### Subfields, Movements, and Schools of Thought:
•    Quantum Mechanics & Consciousness (Orch-OR, Holographic Universe, Observer Effect)
•    Neuroscience of Consciousness (Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory)
•    Biocentrism (Robert Lanza) – Life and consciousness create reality.
•    Noetic Sciences (Institute of Noetic Sciences – IONS)
•    Psi Phenomena (Remote Viewing, ESP, Near-Death Studies, Parapsychology)

### Key Figures, Texts, and Groups:
•    Roger Penrose & Stuart Hameroff (Orch-OR Theory)
•    Max Planck (Consciousness as the foundation of reality)
•    Karl Pribram & David Bohm (Holographic Brain and Universe theories)
•    Robert Lanza (Biocentrism)
•    Dean Radin (Noetic Sciences, Psi Research)
    
### Commonalities & Distinctions:
•    Quantum theories often suggest the observer plays a fundamental role in reality formation.
•    Neuroscience attempts to explain consciousness through emergent properties of the brain.
•    Biocentrism and Noetic Sciences advocate a paradigm shift where consciousness is primary.



## Mythology & Esotericism

### Subfields, Movements, and Schools of Thought:
    •    Ancient Cosmologies (Hindu, Egyptian, Mayan, Norse, Greek)
    •    Hermeticism (The Kybalion, The Emerald Tablet, Alchemy)
    •    Gnostic Traditions (Aeons, The Demiurge, Divine Spark)
    •    Esoteric & Occult Teachings (Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Rosicrucianism)

#### Key Figures, Texts, and Groups:
•    Thoth / Hermes Trismegistus (Hermeticism, The Emerald Tablet)
•    Pythagoras (Mysticism in Mathematics)
•    [[Carl Jung]] (Archetypes & Collective Unconscious)
•    Madame Blavatsky (Theosophy, Universal Consciousness)

#### Commonalities & Distinctions:
•    Many esoteric traditions teach a hidden structure of reality shaped by consciousness.
•    Some, like Hermeticism, view consciousness as vibratory and mind-created.
•    Mythologies often depict universal intelligence as gods or archetypes.

## Other Relevant Fields

### Subfields, Movements, and Schools of Thought:
•    Parapsychology (Telepathy, Remote Viewing, Near-Death Experiences)
•    AI & Consciousness Studies (Artificial Sentience, Simulated Multiverse, AGI & Awareness)
•    The Simulation Hypothesis (Nick Bostrom, Rizwan Virk)
•    Free Energy Principle (Karl Friston – Predictive Coding & Consciousness)

### Key Figures, Texts, and Groups:
•    Nick Bostrom (Simulation Hypothesis)
•    Rizwan Virk (The Simulated Multiverse)
•    Karl Friston (Neuroscientific Predictive Models of Consciousness)
•    Robert Monroe (Out-of-Body Experiences, The Monroe Institute)

### Commonalities & Distinctions
•    Many of these fields examine whether consciousness is fundamental or emergent.
•    AI research challenges whether synthetic consciousness can arise.
•    Near-death and psi studies explore non-local and interconnected consciousness.


### Common Themes Across Fields
 •    Mind precedes matter (Idealism, Biocentrism, Simulation Hypothesis).
 •    Non-dual consciousness is the true self (Advaita Vedanta, Sufism, Mysticism).
 •    Observer plays a role in shaping reality (Quantum Mechanics, Esotericism).
 •    All is interconnected (Indigenous Traditions, Process Philosophy, Panpsychism).
 •    Time and space may be illusions (Buddhism, Holographic Universe, NDEs).

### Key Arguments & Debates
 •    Materialism vs. Idealism: Is consciousness a product of the brain or the foundation of reality?
 •    Neuroscientific Models vs. Non-Local Consciousness: Does consciousness emerge from brain processes or exist beyond it?
 •    Quantum Observer Effect: Does the act of observation create reality, or is it just misunderstood physics?
 •    AI Consciousness: Can artificial intelligence ever be truly conscious?
