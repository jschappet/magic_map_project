## Introduction
Adi Shankaracharya, an influential philosopher and theologian from India, is best known for consolidating the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, which emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality. He lived in the early 8th century CE and traveled extensively across the Indian subcontinent, advocating for the understanding of Brahman as the ultimate reality and the self (Atman) as non-different from it. His teachings challenge the illusion of Maya, guiding individuals towards liberation (Moksha) and the realization of their unlimited potential.

## Relevance
Understanding one's true self as Brahman, beyond the veil of illusion (Maya), is central to Shankaracharya's philosophy. This realization is not merely an intellectual exercise but a transformative experience that leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death (Samsara). By recognizing the unity of Atman and Brahman, individuals can unlock their unlimited potential, transcending limitations imposed by the material world and achieving profound inner peace and enlightenment.
