# Humans/Rupert Sheldrake

## Introduction
Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist and author known for his controversial theory of morphic resonance. This concept suggests that all living organisms share a collective memory that influences their development and behavior. Sheldrake's work intersects both science and philosophy, challenging traditional views of biology and consciousness.

## Relevance
Sheldrake's idea of morphic resonance posits that humans are interconnected through a shared field of memories and experiences, which can influence individual potential and evolution. This concept encourages a re-examination of how we understand learning, behavior, and the development of species, suggesting that our collective experiences shape not only our past but also our future.
