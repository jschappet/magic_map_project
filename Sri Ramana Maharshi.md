## Introduction
Sri Ramana Maharshi, born as Venkataraman Iyer in 1879 in Tamil Nadu, India, is regarded as one of the most revered spiritual teachers of the 20th century. He is known for his teachings on self-inquiry and the nature of the self, emphasizing the importance of realizing one's true nature through direct experience rather than intellectual understanding. His simple yet profound approach to spirituality attracted countless seekers, and his ashram in Tiruvannamalai continues to be a center for spiritual learning and practice.

## Relevance
The teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi align closely with the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His emphasis on self-inquiry encourages individuals to look beyond the ego and recognize their true nature as pure consciousness. This perspective supports the idea that awareness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes but a fundamental aspect of existence that shapes reality. Maharshi's insights into the nature of the self suggest that intention and awareness play crucial roles in our experiences and interactions, highlighting the interconnectedness of all beings and the universe itself. His teachings encourage a shift from a fragmented understanding of consciousness to a holistic view that recognizes the unity of all existence.
