# Introduction
The Upanishads are ancient Indian texts that form the philosophical basis of Hinduism. They are considered the end part of the Vedas, which are the oldest sacred scriptures of Hinduism. Written in Sanskrit, the Upanishads explore profound concepts such as the nature of reality, the self (Atman), and the ultimate reality (Brahman). These texts encourage introspection and meditation, guiding individuals on their spiritual journey toward enlightenment. The Upanishads emphasize the idea that the individual self (Atman) is intrinsically connected to the universal consciousness (Brahman), suggesting a non-dualistic view of existence.

# Relevance
The teachings of the Upanishads support the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. They propose that Atman, or the individual self, is not separate from Brahman, the ultimate reality, highlighting the interconnectedness of all beings. This perspective aligns with modern scientific explorations in quantum physics, which suggest that consciousness may play a crucial role in shaping the fabric of existence. Key ideas from the Upanishads, such as the notion that "you are that" (Tat Tvam Asi), emphasize that awareness and intention are integral to the manifestation of reality. This interconnectedness of consciousness invites individuals to recognize their role in the universe, fostering a deeper understanding of existence and the nature of life itself.
