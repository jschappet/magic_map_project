# Introduction
The Upanishads are ancient Indian texts that form the philosophical basis of Hinduism. They are considered the end part of the Vedas, which are the oldest sacred scriptures of Hinduism. Written in Sanskrit, the Upanishads explore profound concepts such as the nature of reality, the self (Atman), and the ultimate reality (Brahman). These texts encourage introspection and meditation, guiding individuals on their spiritual journey toward enlightenment.

# Relevance
The teachings of the Upanishads remain relevant today as they address universal questions about existence, consciousness, and the nature of the universe. Their insights into the self and the interconnectedness of all beings resonate with modern philosophical and spiritual inquiries. The Upanishads have influenced various philosophical movements, both in the East and the West, and continue to inspire seekers of truth and wisdom.
