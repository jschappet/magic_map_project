# Introduction
Morphic resonance is a concept introduced by biologist Rupert Sheldrake, proposing that there are non-physical fields that influence the development and behavior of organisms. These fields are thought to be shaped by the collective memories and habits of similar organisms over time. The theory challenges conventional scientific views and suggests that nature is inherently interconnected through these resonance fields.

# Relevance
Morphic resonance has implications across various fields, including biology, psychology, and even social sciences. It offers a new perspective on how habits, instincts, and behaviors can be transmitted across generations, impacting evolution and learning processes. Understanding morphic resonance can lead to insights into collective consciousness, cultural evolution, and the interconnectedness of life.
