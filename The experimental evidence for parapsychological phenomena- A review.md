# Introduction
Parapsychology is a field that investigates phenomena that seem to defy conventional scientific understanding, including telepathy, psychokinesis, and precognition. This review aims to summarize the experimental evidence for such phenomena, evaluating the methodologies used and the implications of the findings for both science and society.

# Relevance
The study of parapsychological phenomena is relevant not only for understanding human consciousness and cognition but also for exploring the boundaries of scientific inquiry. As society becomes increasingly interested in the unexplained, the investigation of these phenomena could have significant implications for psychology, neuroscience, and even philosophy.
