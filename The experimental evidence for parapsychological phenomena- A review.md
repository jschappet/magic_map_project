# Introduction
Parapsychology is a field that investigates phenomena that seem to defy conventional scientific understanding, including telepathy, psychokinesis, and precognition. These phenomena challenge the traditional boundaries of science and raise questions about the nature of consciousness. The experimental evidence in parapsychology often suggests that human consciousness may extend beyond the physical body, indicating a non-local aspect that is interconnected with the universe. This review aims to summarize the experimental evidence for such phenomena, evaluating the methodologies used and the implications of the findings for both science and society.

# Relevance
The study of parapsychological phenomena supports the view that consciousness is the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Research in this field suggests that consciousness may not be confined to individual minds but rather exists in a shared, collective domain. Key contributions, such as Dean Radin's work on the role of intention in influencing random number generators, indicate that awareness and intention can shape outcomes in ways that defy conventional explanations. Additionally, findings from experiments in telepathy and psychokinesis imply that human consciousness might interact with the physical world in profound ways, challenging our understanding of causality and existence. This perspective has significant implications for various disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy, as it encourages a reevaluation of the nature of reality and our place within it.
