# Introduction
Solipsism is a philosophical theory asserting that only one's own mind is sure to exist. It raises questions about the nature of reality, perception, and existence. This document explores solipsism, its implications, and its relevance in contemporary discussions.

# Relevance
In an age of digital communication and virtual realities, solipsism has gained renewed interest. The rise of artificial intelligence, virtual environments, and social media challenges traditional notions of reality and self.
