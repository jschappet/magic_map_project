## Introduction
Michael Levin is a prominent biologist and researcher known for his groundbreaking work in the field of regenerative medicine and developmental biology. He is a professor at Tufts University, where he investigates the role of electrical signals in the development and regeneration of biological systems. Levin's research emphasizes the interplay between biology and consciousness, exploring how cellular communication and bioelectricity contribute to the organization and regeneration of living organisms.

## Relevance
Michael Levin's work supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His research highlights that awareness and intention can influence biological processes, suggesting that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but an integral aspect of life itself. Levin's findings on bioelectricity demonstrate how cells communicate and organize, which implies that consciousness may play a critical role in shaping existence and guiding development. This perspective aligns with the idea that consciousness is a universal force that underlies and connects all living beings.
