# Introduction
The Orch-OR Hypothesis, proposed by physicist Roger Penrose and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, suggests that consciousness arises from quantum processes within neuronal microtubules. This theory challenges classical views of consciousness and aims to bridge the gap between neuroscience and quantum physics. The hypothesis posits that quantum computations in microtubules lead to moments of conscious experience, which could explain the subjective nature of awareness.

# Relevance
The Orch-OR Hypothesis is significant for several reasons:
- It provides a novel framework for understanding consciousness that integrates physics and biology.
- The hypothesis has implications for artificial intelligence and the development of conscious machines.
- It invites interdisciplinary research across neuroscience, psychology, and quantum physics, fostering collaboration among diverse fields.
- The theory raises questions about the nature of reality and the role of observation in the universe.
