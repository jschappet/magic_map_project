# Introduction
Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other(s), even when the particles are separated by large distances. This concept challenges classical intuitions about the nature of reality and has profound implications for our understanding of the universe. The phenomenon of entanglement has led to significant philosophical discussions regarding the nature of consciousness and reality, suggesting that interconnectedness may extend beyond the physical realm.

# Relevance
Quantum entanglement supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. The idea that particles can remain connected across vast distances hints at a deeper level of reality where separation is an illusion. Researchers like David Bohm have proposed that the universe is an undivided whole, and consciousness may play a role in shaping our perception of this interconnectedness. Additionally, experiments in quantum mechanics, such as those involving the observer effect, suggest that awareness or intention may influence the outcomes of quantum events. This perspective opens up new avenues for understanding the relationship between consciousness and the physical world, positing that our awareness is intricately linked to the fabric of reality itself.
