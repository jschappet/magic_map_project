# Introduction
Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other(s), even when the particles are separated by large distances. This concept challenges classical intuitions about the nature of reality and has profound implications for our understanding of the universe.

# Relevance
Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in various fields, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. It is considered a key resource for developing technologies that leverage quantum mechanics to perform tasks that are impossible or inefficient with classical systems. Understanding entanglement is vital for advancing theoretical physics and practical applications in technology.
