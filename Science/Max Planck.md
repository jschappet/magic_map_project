## Introduction
Max Planck was a German physicist who is best known for his role in the development of quantum theory, which revolutionized our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. Born on April 23, 1858, in Kiel, Germany, Planck's work laid the foundation for modern physics, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. His introduction of the concept of quantization of energy led to significant advancements in various fields, including chemistry, materials science, and information technology.

## Relevance
The contributions of Max Planck to physics are still relevant today, influencing contemporary research in quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. His ideas on energy quanta have paved the way for technologies such as semiconductors, lasers, and quantum computing. Understanding Planck's work is crucial for students and professionals in physics and engineering, as it provides the fundamental principles that govern modern scientific inquiry.
