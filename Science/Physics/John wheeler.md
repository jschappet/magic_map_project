# Introduction
John Wheeler was a prominent American theoretical physicist who made significant contributions to the field of physics, particularly in the areas of general relativity and quantum mechanics. His work not only advanced scientific understanding but also inspired generations of physicists. Wheeler is best known for coining the term "black hole" and for his role in the development of the concept of geons and the "participatory universe."

# Relevance
Wheeler's ideas profoundly support the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His concept of the "participatory universe" suggests that observers play a crucial role in shaping physical reality, implying that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes but an integral component in the fabric of existence. Wheeler's assertion that "we cannot separate the observer from the observed" indicates that awareness and intention may influence the outcomes of quantum events, challenging traditional notions of objectivity in science. His exploration of geons and black holes also hints at deeper connections between consciousness and the cosmos, suggesting that the universe is a dynamic interplay of information and awareness. These contributions encourage a holistic view of reality, where consciousness is intertwined with the physical world.
