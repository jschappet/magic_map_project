# Introduction
Rupert Sheldrake is a biochemist and author known for his controversial ideas in the field of science, particularly concerning the nature of consciousness and the concept of morphic resonance. His work challenges traditional scientific paradigms and proposes that memory and habits are not solely confined to individual organisms but are influenced by collective memory across species.

# Relevance
Sheldrake's theories support the view that consciousness is a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected aspect of reality. His concept of morphic resonance suggests that all living beings are linked through a shared field of information that transcends individual experiences. This interconnectedness implies that awareness and intention are not isolated phenomena but play a crucial role in shaping existence. By proposing that habits and memories are influenced by collective experiences, Sheldrake invites a re-evaluation of how consciousness interacts with the material world, suggesting that our thoughts and intentions can resonate beyond the confines of our individual minds.
