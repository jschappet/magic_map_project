# Introduction
The Stargate Program is a classified initiative that began in the 1970s, focused on the exploration of psychic phenomena and the potential for using these abilities in intelligence and military operations. The program aimed to investigate the capabilities of human consciousness beyond conventional limits, employing techniques such as remote viewing and telepathy. It has been linked with various organizations, including the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and has been the subject of numerous investigations and studies.

# Relevance
The Stargate Program supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Its research into psychic phenomena suggests that human awareness and intention can transcend physical boundaries, influencing events and information retrieval in ways that challenge traditional scientific paradigms. Key contributions from the program include findings that indicate consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but an essential component of existence that interacts with the fabric of reality. This perspective aligns with various metaphysical theories and suggests that understanding consciousness could unlock new dimensions of human potential and capabilities.
