# Introduction
Advaita Vedanta is a school of Hindu philosophy and spiritual practice that teaches the non-duality of the individual soul (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman). It emphasizes the idea that the true self is not separate from the universe, and that realizing this unity is the key to liberation (Moksha). The teachings of Advaita Vedanta are rooted in the Upanishads, and were further developed by philosophers such as Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century.

# Relevance
Advaita Vedanta remains relevant today as it offers profound insights into the nature of existence, consciousness, and the self. In a world often characterized by division and conflict, the non-dual perspective encourages individuals to transcend their ego and realize their interconnectedness with all beings. This philosophy can provide a framework for personal growth, spiritual development, and a more harmonious way of living.
