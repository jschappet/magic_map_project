# Introduction
Advaita Vedanta is a school of Hindu philosophy and spiritual practice that teaches the non-duality of the individual soul (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman). It emphasizes the idea that the true self is not separate from the universe, and that realizing this unity is the key to liberation (Moksha). The teachings of Advaita Vedanta are rooted in the Upanishads, and were further developed by philosophers such as Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century.

# Relevance
Advaita Vedanta supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. This philosophy posits that the individual self (Atman) is not distinct from the universal consciousness (Brahman), suggesting that all beings share a common source of awareness. Key contributions from Advaita Vedanta highlight that realization of this non-dual nature can lead to a profound understanding of existence, where awareness and intention shape our experiences. The teachings encourage the exploration of self-inquiry and meditation, leading to insights that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes, but rather the essence that underlies and connects all of reality. This interconnectedness fosters a sense of unity and compassion, promoting a more harmonious existence.
