## Introduction
Pythagoras of Samos was an ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician best known for his contributions to mathematics, particularly the Pythagorean theorem. He founded a religious movement known as Pythagoreanism, which blended mathematics, mysticism, and ethics. Pythagoras believed in the significance of numbers and their relationships, positing that they were the essence of all reality. His teachings influenced not only mathematics but also philosophy and spirituality, establishing a framework that would resonate through centuries.

## Relevance
Pythagoras' work supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His emphasis on the importance of numbers and their relationships suggests that the universe is structured in a way that is inherently mathematical, implying a deeper order beyond mere physical existence. The Pythagorean belief in the harmony of the cosmos reflects the idea that consciousness and awareness are integral to shaping our reality. This interconnectedness resonates with modern theories in quantum physics and consciousness studies, where intention and awareness are seen as pivotal in influencing the material world. Pythagoreanism's mystical elements also hint at a collective consciousness, suggesting that individual awareness is part of a larger, unified existence.

Pythagoras was born on the island of Samos, Greece, and later moved to Croton (modern-day Crotone, Italy), where he founded a religious community that practiced his teachings. The legacy of Pythagoras can be traced to various locations in the Mediterranean, particularly in ancient Greece and southern Italy, where his ideas influenced both mathematical thought and spiritual practices.
