# Introduction
Dr. Steven Greer is the founder of the CE-5 movement, which focuses on establishing conscious contact with extraterrestrial beings through meditation and group coherence. He emphasizes that interactions with extraterrestrial intelligence occur through the field of mind, advocating for a peaceful and proactive approach to these encounters.

# Relevance
Dr. Greer's work supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His teachings suggest that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of biological processes but a primary force that shapes existence. Through the CE-5 protocols, individuals are encouraged to tap into their own consciousness, fostering a sense of unity with the universe and other forms of intelligent life. Key contributions from Greer include the idea that awareness and intention can influence reality, as evidenced by the reported experiences of individuals who have successfully made contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. This perspective aligns with various findings in consciousness studies that propose a collective consciousness, where individual thoughts and intentions can resonate and create meaningful interactions across dimensions.
