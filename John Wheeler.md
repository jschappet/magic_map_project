## Introduction
John Wheeler was a prominent American theoretical physicist known for his work in quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the philosophy of science. He played a crucial role in the development of concepts such as "black holes" and "wormholes," and famously coined the term "it from bit," suggesting that information is fundamental to the fabric of reality. His ideas have significantly influenced modern physics and our understanding of consciousness.

## Relevance
John Wheeler's work supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His concept of "participatory universe" posits that observers play an active role in shaping physical reality through their observations and choices. This aligns with the idea that awareness and intention are not merely byproducts of physical processes but integral to the structure of existence itself. Wheeler's insights into quantum mechanics, particularly the notion that particles exist in a state of potential until observed, suggest that consciousness may be a key player in determining the nature of reality.
