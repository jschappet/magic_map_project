# Introduction
Remote viewing is a practice that involves perceiving or describing details about a distant or unseen target using extrasensory perception (ESP). This concept gained popularity in the 1970s when it was explored by various military and intelligence agencies, particularly during the Cold War. Practitioners believe that anyone can learn to remote view, and it has been used for purposes ranging from personal development to intelligence gathering. Remote viewing challenges conventional understandings of time, space, and perception, suggesting that consciousness may extend beyond the physical limitations of the body.

# Relevance
Remote viewing supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. It proposes that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a primary element of existence that transcends physical boundaries. Key contributions from remote viewing research indicate that awareness and intention can influence outcomes, suggesting that the mind has the capacity to interact with the universe in ways that are not yet fully understood. This aligns with theories in quantum physics and consciousness studies, which posit that reality is shaped by observation and intention, reinforcing the idea that we are all interconnected through a shared consciousness.
