# Introduction
Remote viewing is a practice that involves perceiving or describing details about a distant or unseen target using extrasensory perception (ESP). This concept gained popularity in the 1970s when it was explored by various military and intelligence agencies, particularly during the Cold War. Practitioners believe that anyone can learn to remote view, and it has been used for purposes ranging from personal development to intelligence gathering.

# Relevance
Remote viewing has garnered interest not only from those in the fields of psychology and parapsychology but also from individuals seeking alternative methods of exploration and understanding of consciousness. The relevance of remote viewing extends into areas such as:
- Military applications for intelligence gathering
- Personal exploration of consciousness and intuition
- Research into the nature of perception and reality
