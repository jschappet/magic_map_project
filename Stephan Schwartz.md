# Introduction

Remote viewing is the practice of seeking information about a distant or unseen target using extrasensory perception (ESP) or "anomalous cognition." This phenomenon has been the subject of scientific investigation and has implications for our understanding of consciousness and the nature of reality. The evidence for remote viewing spans decades of research and experimentation, showcasing its potential applications in various fields.

# Relevance

Remote viewing supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Research in this area suggests that consciousness is not confined to the brain and can operate beyond the limits of space and time. Key contributions from studies indicate that intention and awareness are crucial components in shaping our experiences and interactions with the universe. Findings from remote viewing experiments demonstrate that individuals can access information that transcends conventional sensory modalities, suggesting that consciousness may be a universal field from which all knowledge and existence emerge. This perspective invites a profound reevaluation of how we understand reality, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the potential for human consciousness to influence and interact with the fabric of existence.
