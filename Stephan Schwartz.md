# Introduction

Remote viewing is the practice of seeking information about a distant or unseen target using extrasensory perception (ESP) or "anomalous cognition." This phenomenon has been the subject of scientific investigation and has implications for our understanding of consciousness and the nature of reality. The evidence for remote viewing spans decades of research and experimentation, showcasing its potential applications in various fields.

# Relevance

Understanding remote viewing is crucial in exploring the boundaries of human perception and consciousness. It challenges traditional scientific paradigms and invites a reevaluation of what is possible beyond conventional sensory experiences. The implications of remote viewing extend to areas such as intelligence gathering, archaeology, and personal development, making it a topic of significant interest in both scientific and metaphysical communities.
