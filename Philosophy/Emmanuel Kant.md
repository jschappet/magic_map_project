# Introduction

Emmanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a German philosopher who is considered one of the central figures in modern philosophy. His work in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics has had a profound impact on various fields, including metaphysics, political theory, and the philosophy of religion. Kant's critical philosophy, particularly his "Critique of Pure Reason," addresses the limitations and scope of human understanding, while his ethical framework, known as deontological ethics, emphasizes duty and moral law.

# Relevance

Kant's ideas continue to be relevant today, influencing contemporary debates in philosophy, politics, and ethics. His concepts of autonomy, moral imperatives, and the categorical imperative are foundational in discussions about human rights and moral responsibility. Additionally, his thoughts on the nature of knowledge and perception challenge us to consider the ways in which we understand reality and our place within it.
