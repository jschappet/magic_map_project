## Introduction
Carl Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. He is best known for his concepts of the collective unconscious and archetypes, which have profoundly influenced psychology, philosophy, and the understanding of human potential. Jung's work emphasizes the importance of the unconscious mind and the shared experiences that shape human behavior and culture.

## Relevance
Jung's theories have paved the way for a deeper understanding of the shared human experience. The concept of the collective unconscious suggests that all humans share a set of memories and ideas, which can lead to a greater understanding of ourselves and others. His archetypes, such as the Hero, the Mother, and the Shadow, provide a framework for exploring the common themes in human stories and experiences, highlighting our shared potential and challenges.
