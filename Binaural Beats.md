# Introduction
Binaural beats are an auditory illusion created when two slightly different frequencies are played in each ear. The brain perceives a third tone, which is the mathematical difference between the two frequencies. This phenomenon is often used for relaxation, meditation, and enhancing cognitive functions. Research suggests that listening to binaural beats can help reduce anxiety, improve focus, and promote a deeper state of relaxation.

# Relevance
In today's fast-paced world, stress and anxiety are prevalent issues. Binaural beats offer a non-invasive way to manage these conditions and enhance mental well-being. They are becoming increasingly popular among individuals seeking alternative methods for personal development, mindfulness, and mental clarity. Furthermore, binaural beats are utilized in various therapeutic settings, including counseling and wellness programs.
