## Introduction
"A Course in Miracles" (ACIM) is a spiritual self-study program that aims to bring about a profound transformation in the way individuals perceive themselves and the world around them. First published in 1975, the course consists of a text, a workbook for students, and a manual for teachers. It emphasizes the importance of love, forgiveness, and the practice of inner peace, guiding individuals toward a deeper understanding of their true nature and the nature of reality.

## Relevance
The teachings of "A Course in Miracles" align with the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. The course posits that our perceptions and beliefs shape our experiences, suggesting that awareness and intention play a crucial role in shaping existence. By emphasizing forgiveness and the release of fear, ACIM encourages individuals to transcend the ego and recognize their interconnectedness with all beings. This perspective supports the idea that consciousness is not merely a product of the brain but a universal, shared experience that influences the fabric of reality.
