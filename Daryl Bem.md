With a career spanning over 40 years, Bem has held professorships at multiple Ivy League institutions and has an extensive publication record. His 2011 paper, "Feeling the Future," sparked significant debate and interest in the scientific community due to its bold claims regarding anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect.

Bem's work challenges traditional views on time and cognition, raising questions about the nature of human perception and the limits of scientific inquiry. His research has implications not only for psychology but also for broader philosophical discussions about determinism and free will. The ongoing discussions and replications of his studies contribute to the understanding of experimental psychology and the potential for anomalous phenomena.
