# Introduction
Phenomenology is a philosophical movement that focuses on the structures of experience and consciousness. Founded by Edmund Husserl in the early 20th century, it seeks to explore how individuals perceive and interpret the world around them. By examining the essence of experiences, phenomenology aims to uncover the fundamental nature of reality as it appears to consciousness. This exploration emphasizes subjective experience and the importance of first-person perspectives in understanding the nature of existence.

# Relevance
Phenomenology supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing the subjective nature of experience. It posits that consciousness is not merely a passive receiver of information but an active participant in shaping reality. Key contributions from phenomenologists, such as Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, highlight how awareness and intentionality influence perception and understanding. For instance, Husserl's concept of "intentionality" suggests that consciousness is always directed towards something, indicating that our awareness plays a crucial role in constructing our reality. This interconnectedness of consciousness implies that individual experiences are not isolated but rather part of a larger, shared human experience, reinforcing the idea that our perceptions and intentions shape existence itself.
