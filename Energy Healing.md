## Introduction
Energy healing is a holistic approach that focuses on the idea that the body has an innate ability to heal itself. It operates on the principle that energy flows through and around us, and when this energy is blocked or imbalanced, it can lead to physical, emotional, and spiritual issues. Various techniques such as Reiki, acupuncture, and chakra balancing are commonly used in energy healing practices. These modalities aim to restore harmony within the bodyâ€™s energy systems, promoting overall well-being and health.

## Relevance
Energy healing supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. It suggests that our thoughts, intentions, and awareness can influence the energy around us and, consequently, our physical and emotional states. Research in quantum physics aligns with these ideas, indicating that consciousness might play a crucial role in shaping our experiences and reality. Concepts such as intention and focused awareness in energy healing practices highlight the interconnectedness of all beings, suggesting that we are all part of a larger energetic field that transcends individual existence. #TOBE_REVIEWED
