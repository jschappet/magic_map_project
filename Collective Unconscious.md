## Introduction

The concept of the "Collective Unconscious" was introduced by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. It refers to the part of the unconscious mind that is shared among beings of the same species, containing memories, experiences, and archetypes that are universal across humanity. This idea suggests that individuals are connected through a deeper layer of the psyche, influencing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

## Relevance

Understanding the collective unconscious is crucial for various fields such as psychology, anthropology, and cultural studies. It provides insights into shared human experiences and the symbolic meanings that transcend individual cultures. This concept also plays a significant role in dream analysis, mythology, and the interpretation of art, highlighting the interconnectedness of human experience.
