## Introduction

The concept of the "Collective Unconscious" was introduced by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. It refers to the part of the unconscious mind that is shared among beings of the same species, containing memories, experiences, and archetypes that are universal across humanity. This idea suggests that individuals are connected through a deeper layer of the psyche, influencing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Jung proposed that this collective layer of consciousness transcends individual experiences, allowing for a shared psychological heritage that shapes human experience and expression.

## Relevance

Understanding the collective unconscious supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Jung's idea suggests that consciousness is not merely a product of individual minds but rather a shared phenomenon that connects all humans. This interconnectedness implies that our thoughts, feelings, and intentions can resonate across time and space, shaping our collective reality. Key contributions from Jungian psychology highlight the role of archetypes—universal symbols and themes that emerge in dreams, myths, and art—as evidence of this shared consciousness. The collective unconscious provides a framework for understanding how awareness and intention can influence existence, suggesting that our inner worlds are deeply intertwined with the fabric of reality itself.
