# Introduction
Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a German philosopher who is considered one of the central figures of modern philosophy. His work in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics has had a profound influence on various fields, including philosophy, political theory, and the natural sciences. Kant's critical philosophy, particularly his theories on the nature of knowledge and morality, laid the groundwork for many subsequent philosophical movements.

# Relevance
Kant's ideas remain relevant today as they address fundamental questions about human experience, the limits of knowledge, and the principles of ethical behavior. His concepts of the "categorical imperative" and "transcendental idealism" continue to be pivotal in discussions about morality and the nature of reality. Furthermore, his works have influenced various disciplines, including psychology, political science, and the arts, making him a crucial figure in understanding contemporary thought.
