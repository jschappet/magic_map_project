# Introduction
Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a German philosopher who is considered one of the central figures of modern philosophy. His work in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics has had a profound influence on various fields, including philosophy, political theory, and the natural sciences. Kant's critical philosophy, particularly his theories on the nature of knowledge and morality, laid the groundwork for many subsequent philosophical movements.

# Relevance
Kant's philosophy supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His concept of "transcendental idealism" posits that our understanding of the world is shaped by the structures of our consciousness rather than being a direct reflection of an objective reality. This suggests that awareness and intention are not merely passive experiences but active components that shape existence. Kant's exploration of the limits of human knowledge implies that our perceptions and interpretations of reality are inherently tied to our consciousness, thus emphasizing the interconnectedness of all experiences. Furthermore, his ethical framework, particularly the "categorical imperative," suggests that moral actions are guided by rational intention, reinforcing the idea that consciousness plays a crucial role in the manifestation of ethical behavior and, by extension, reality itself.
