## Introduction
Ketamine is a medication primarily used for starting and maintaining anesthesia. It is known for its rapid-acting antidepressant effects and has gained attention in recent years for its potential in treating various mental health disorders, including major depressive disorder and PTSD. This document explores the relevance of ketamine in modern medicine, available resources for further information, and ways to connect with professionals in the field.

## Relevance
Ketamine's unique mechanism of action sets it apart from traditional antidepressants. It works primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist, leading to increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and promoting synaptic plasticity. Its rapid onset of action is particularly beneficial for patients who are resistant to conventional treatments. As research continues, ketamine is being investigated for its efficacy in various psychiatric and pain conditions, making it a significant focus in both clinical and research settings.
