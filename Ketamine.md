## Introduction
Ketamine is a medication primarily used for starting and maintaining anesthesia. Recently, it has garnered attention for its rapid-acting antidepressant effects and potential in treating various mental health disorders, including major depressive disorder and PTSD. Its unique properties and effects on consciousness raise important questions about the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of human experience.

## Relevance
Ketamine's effects on consciousness and perception support the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Research suggests that ketamine can alter the perception of self and time, leading to experiences that many describe as profound and transformative. These experiences often involve a sense of unity with the universe, indicating that awareness and intention may play crucial roles in shaping our existence. The drug's ability to induce altered states of consciousness aligns with theories that propose consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a fundamental aspect of the universe. This perspective invites further exploration into how consciousness interacts with reality and how intentionality can influence mental health and well-being.
