## Introduction
Non-dualism is a philosophical and spiritual perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things and the idea that the ultimate reality transcends dualistic distinctions such as self and other, subject and object. Rooted in various religious and philosophical traditions, including Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism and certain schools of Buddhism, non-dualism suggests that the perceived separation between the individual and the universe is an illusion. This understanding invites individuals to explore a deeper sense of self and reality, often leading to profound insights and transformative experiences.

## Relevance
Non-dualism supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by proposing that the separation we perceive in our everyday lives is a construct of the mind. Key contributions from non-dual philosophies highlight that awareness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes but rather the essence of existence itself. This perspective posits that consciousness is a singular, universal field from which all phenomena arise, suggesting that intention and awareness can shape our experiences and reality. Such insights encourage individuals to explore their own consciousness, fostering a sense of unity and interconnectedness with all beings and the cosmos.
