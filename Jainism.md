## Introduction
Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence (ahimsa), truth (satya), and asceticism. Founded around the 6th century BCE, it promotes a path of spiritual purity and enlightenment through the practice of non-attachment and self-discipline. Jains believe in the concept of karma and the cycle of birth and rebirth (samsara), striving for liberation (moksha) through ethical living and spiritual practices.

## Relevance
Jainism supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality through its core teachings on non-violence and the interconnectedness of all living beings. The Jain philosophy posits that all souls (jivas) are equal and that every action has a profound impact on the universe. This perspective aligns with the idea that consciousness is not merely an individual experience but a collective phenomenon that shapes existence. The emphasis on awareness and intention in Jain practices suggests that the way individuals interact with the world can influence their spiritual journey and the well-being of the entire cosmos. Through meditation and ethical living, Jains cultivate a heightened state of awareness, reflecting the interconnected nature of reality and the role of consciousness in creating harmony.
