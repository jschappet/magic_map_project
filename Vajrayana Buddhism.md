# Introduction
Vajrayana Buddhism, often referred to as Tantric Buddhism or the Diamond Vehicle, is a complex and esoteric form of Buddhism that emphasizes the use of rituals, meditation, and symbolic practices to achieve enlightenment. Originating in India, it later spread to Tibet, Bhutan, and Mongolia, where it became a dominant spiritual tradition. Vajrayana incorporates elements from both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, while also integrating indigenous beliefs and practices.
