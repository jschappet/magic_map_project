## Introduction
Gnosticism is an ancient religious and philosophical movement that emerged in the early centuries of the Common Era. It encompasses a diverse range of beliefs and practices, often emphasizing personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) over orthodox teachings and institutions. Central to Gnostic thought is the idea that the material world is flawed or illusory, and that true knowledge leads to spiritual enlightenment and liberation from the confines of physical existence. Gnosticism draws from various religious traditions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Hellenistic philosophies, and has influenced many spiritual and esoteric movements throughout history.

## Relevance
Gnosticism supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing the importance of inner knowledge and personal experience in understanding existence. Gnostic texts often highlight the distinction between the material and spiritual realms, suggesting that true reality lies beyond the physical world. This aligns with contemporary ideas in consciousness studies that posit awareness and intention as crucial elements in shaping our experience of reality. The Gnostic pursuit of enlightenment through personal insight reflects the notion that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a primary aspect of the universe, interconnected and capable of transcending physical limitations.
