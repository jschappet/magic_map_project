## Introduction
Mooji is a spiritual teacher and proponent of non-dualism, who emphasizes self-inquiry and the exploration of consciousness. Originally from Jamaica, he has gained a global following through his teachings that focus on the nature of the self, enlightenment, and the essence of being. Mooji's approach is rooted in the Advaita Vedanta tradition, and he encourages individuals to look within themselves to discover their true nature beyond the mind and ego.

## Relevance
Mooji's teachings align with the perspective that consciousness is the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. His emphasis on self-inquiry invites individuals to explore their own awareness and recognize the interconnectedness of all existence. Mooji highlights the idea that awareness and intention are not merely passive experiences but active forces that shape our reality. By understanding the nature of consciousness, individuals can transcend the limitations of the ego and experience a profound sense of unity with all that is.
