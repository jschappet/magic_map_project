# Introduction
The occult refers to a broad range of mystical, supernatural, and magical beliefs and practices that are often hidden from mainstream society. This includes various traditions such as astrology, alchemy, divination, and spiritualism. Historically, the occult has been a means for individuals to explore the deeper aspects of existence, seeking to understand the nature of reality and the forces that govern it. The study and practice of the occult can provide insights into the human psyche, the nature of the universe, and the unseen forces that influence our lives.

# Relevance
The study of the occult supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Many occult traditions emphasize the idea that consciousness transcends the physical realm and that our thoughts, intentions, and awareness can influence the fabric of existence. For example, practices like meditation, visualization, and ritual magic suggest that focused intention can manifest changes in the material world, aligning with the idea that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a primary force in shaping reality. Additionally, concepts from alchemy and astrology propose that there are underlying connections between the microcosm (individuals) and the macrocosm (the universe), reinforcing the interconnectedness of all things. These insights encourage a deeper exploration of how consciousness interacts with the universe, promoting a holistic understanding of existence.
