# Introduction

Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture proposed by Bernard Baars in the 1980s. It offers a framework for understanding consciousness and the role of attention in cognitive processes. According to GWT, consciousness functions as a global workspace that allows information to be broadcasted to various cognitive systems, enabling integration and coordination of mental processes. This theory has implications across various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. GWT posits that conscious awareness is not just a byproduct of brain activity but a critical component that shapes our understanding of reality.

# Relevance

GWT supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by suggesting that conscious awareness acts as a central hub for integrating and disseminating information across various cognitive domains. This interconnectedness implies that consciousness is not merely confined to individual minds but is part of a larger, collective experience. Key contributions from GWT include the idea that awareness and intention play a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions and interactions with the world. Research indicates that conscious thought can influence decision-making processes, suggesting that our awareness is not just passive but actively participates in the construction of reality. This perspective aligns with theories that view consciousness as a primary aspect of existence, emphasizing its role in the emergence of complex behaviors and social interactions.
