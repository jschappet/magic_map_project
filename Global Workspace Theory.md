# Introduction

Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture proposed by Bernard Baars in the 1980s. It offers a framework for understanding consciousness and the role of attention in cognitive processes. According to GWT, consciousness functions as a global workspace that allows information to be broadcasted to various cognitive systems, enabling integration and coordination of mental processes. This theory has implications across various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

# Relevance

GWT is significant in the study of consciousness as it provides insights into how information becomes accessible for higher cognitive functions. It helps in understanding phenomena such as selective attention, memory retrieval, and the integration of sensory information. Additionally, GWT has influenced research in artificial intelligence, where creating systems that can mimic human-like consciousness and attention is a growing area of interest.
