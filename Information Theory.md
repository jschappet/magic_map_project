# Introduction

Information Theory is a branch of applied mathematics and electrical engineering that involves the quantification of information. It was founded by Claude Shannon in the mid-20th century and has since become a fundamental area of study in various fields, including telecommunications, data compression, cryptography, and machine learning. The theory provides a framework for understanding how information is measured, transmitted, and stored. Recent explorations have also begun to link concepts from Information Theory to consciousness, suggesting that the quantification and transmission of information may play a role in the interconnectedness of reality and the nature of awareness.

# Relevance

Information Theory supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by providing a mathematical framework to understand how information is shared and processed across systems. Some key contributions and ideas include:

- **Interconnectedness of Information**: The principles of Information Theory suggest that information is not merely a linear transmission but rather a complex web of interrelations. This interconnectedness can be likened to the idea that consciousness is a shared experience, transcending individual entities.
  
- **Entropy and Awareness**: The concept of entropy in Information Theory, which quantifies the uncertainty or unpredictability of information, can be metaphorically related to consciousness. Higher entropy may indicate a greater potential for awareness and intention, suggesting that consciousness is a dynamic process shaped by the information it processes.

- **Mutual Information**: This measure of the amount of information shared between variables can be interpreted as a reflection of the interconnectedness of consciousness. It implies that individual awareness is influenced by and contributes to a collective consciousness, supporting the idea of a non-local basis for reality.

- **Quantum Information Theory**: Emerging research in quantum information theory hints at deeper connections between information, consciousness, and the fabric of reality, suggesting that consciousness may play a role in shaping existence at a fundamental level.
