# Introduction

Information Theory is a branch of applied mathematics and electrical engineering that involves the quantification of information. It was founded by Claude Shannon in the mid-20th century and has since become a fundamental area of study in various fields, including telecommunications, data compression, cryptography, and machine learning. The theory provides a framework for understanding how information is measured, transmitted, and stored.

# Relevance

Information Theory is crucial in today's digital age, where vast amounts of data are generated and transmitted every second. It plays a vital role in:

- **Data Compression**: Techniques such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) are based on principles of information theory to reduce the size of data for storage and transmission.
- **Error Detection and Correction**: Information theory provides methods to detect and correct errors that occur during data transmission, ensuring the integrity of information.
- **Cryptography**: The principles of information theory help in the development of secure communication systems by quantifying the uncertainty and predictability of information.
- **Machine Learning**: Concepts such as entropy and mutual information are used to optimize algorithms and improve model performance.
