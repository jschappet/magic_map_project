## Introduction
Tibetan Buddhist philosophy is a rich and profound tradition that combines elements of Indian Buddhism with indigenous Tibetan beliefs. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of reality and the mind, guiding practitioners toward enlightenment. Central to this philosophy is the concept of consciousness, which serves as the foundation for achieving one’s highest potential and realizing the interconnectedness of all beings. Tibetan Buddhism also incorporates practices such as meditation, rituals, and teachings that aim to transform the mind and develop insight into the nature of existence.

## Relevance
Tibetan Buddhist philosophy supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. It posits that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of the brain but a primary aspect of existence that transcends individual experience. Key teachings emphasize that all phenomena arise from the mind and that our perceptions shape our experience of reality. The concept of interdependence, or "pratītyasamutpāda," illustrates how all beings and events are interconnected, suggesting that individual awareness and intention play a crucial role in shaping existence. This interconnectedness fosters compassion and ethical living, as the realization that one's actions affect others deepens the understanding of shared consciousness.
