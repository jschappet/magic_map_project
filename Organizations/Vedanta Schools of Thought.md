## Introduction
Vedanta is a diverse and profound philosophical school within Hinduism that encompasses various interpretations and teachings regarding the nature of reality and the self. At its core, Vedanta focuses on the study of the Upanishads, ancient texts that delve into the relationship between Brahman (the ultimate reality) and Atman (the individual self). The different schools of thought within Vedanta—such as Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, and Dvaita—offer unique perspectives on these concepts, leading to a rich tapestry of philosophical inquiry and spiritual practice. Each school provides its own interpretations, emphasizing different aspects of self-realization and the nature of existence.

## Relevance
The teachings of Vedanta profoundly support the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Central to Vedantic philosophy is the idea that the individual self (Atman) is not separate from the ultimate reality (Brahman); rather, they are one and the same. This non-dualistic perspective suggests that consciousness is the underlying essence of all existence, transcending physical boundaries and societal constructs. 

Key contributions from Vedanta highlight the role of awareness and intention in shaping our experiences and reality. For instance, the concept of "Maya" illustrates how the illusion of separateness can obscure our true nature, while self-inquiry practices encourage individuals to realize their inherent connection to the universe. The teachings advocate that through awakening to this interconnectedness, one can experience profound insights into the nature of existence and cultivate a greater sense of purpose and inner peace.
