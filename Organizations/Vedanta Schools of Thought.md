## Introduction
Vedanta is a diverse and profound philosophical school within Hinduism that encompasses various interpretations and teachings regarding the nature of reality and the self. At its core, Vedanta focuses on the study of the Upanishads, ancient texts that delve into the relationship between Brahman (the ultimate reality) and Atman (the individual self). The different schools of thought within Vedanta—such as Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, and Dvaita—offer unique perspectives on these concepts, leading to a rich tapestry of philosophical inquiry and spiritual practice. Each school provides its own interpretations, emphasizing different aspects of self-realization and the nature of existence.

## Relevance
The teachings of Vedanta are highly relevant in today's world, as they encourage individuals to explore their consciousness and understand their true nature. By transcending the limitations imposed by the ego and societal conditioning, practitioners can achieve inner peace, wisdom, and a profound sense of purpose. The philosophical inquiries posed by the various schools of Vedanta contribute to a comprehensive understanding of existence and spirituality, making it a valuable resource for anyone seeking deeper insights into the self and the universe.
