## Introduction
The Global Consciousness Project (GCP) is an international research initiative that aims to investigate the interconnectedness of human consciousness and its potential impact on global events. By utilizing a network of random number generators (RNGs) placed around the world, the project seeks to explore whether collective human consciousness can influence physical systems, particularly during moments of shared emotional intensity, such as disasters or global celebrations.

## Relevance
The GCP illustrates the profound interconnectedness of human minds and the potential for collective consciousness to shape reality. This exploration not only deepens our understanding of consciousness but also highlights the importance of unity and empathy in addressing global challenges. By examining the data collected from RNGs during significant events, the GCP provides insights into the ways in which human emotions and thoughts might resonate on a global scale.
