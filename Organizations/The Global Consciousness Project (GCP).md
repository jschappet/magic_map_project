## Introduction
The Global Consciousness Project (GCP) is an international research initiative that investigates the interconnectedness of human consciousness and its potential impact on global events. Established in 1998, the project employs a network of random number generators (RNGs) distributed globally to explore whether collective human consciousness can influence physical systems, particularly during moments of shared emotional intensity, such as disasters or global celebrations. By analyzing data from these RNGs, the GCP aims to uncover patterns that may reflect the collective emotional and mental states of humanity.

## Relevance
The GCP supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by suggesting that human awareness and intention can influence physical phenomena. The project provides evidence that during significant global events, such as natural disasters or large-scale celebrations, there are measurable deviations in RNG outputs, indicating a potential link between collective emotional states and physical systems. Key findings from the GCP propose that when large groups of people focus their thoughts and emotions on a shared experience, it may create a coherent field of consciousness that impacts the fabric of reality. This challenges traditional scientific paradigms and suggests that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of brain activity but a fundamental aspect of the universe that can shape existence itself.
