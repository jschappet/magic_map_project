## Introduction
The Baha’i Faith is a world religion that emphasizes the unity of all people and the oneness of humanity. Founded in the 19th century by Baha'u'llah in Persia (modern-day Iran), the faith teaches that all major religions come from the same divine source and advocates for universal justice, equality, and spiritual empowerment. Baha’is believe in the importance of global harmony and strive to create a peaceful and just society through their teachings and community actions.

## Relevance
The Baha’i Faith supports the view of consciousness as the fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing the unity of all existence and the interconnectedness of humanity. Its teachings suggest that every individual has the capacity to contribute to the collective consciousness, shaping reality through awareness and intention. Baha’i principles promote the idea that spiritual growth and collective well-being are achieved through recognizing our shared humanity, which aligns with the notion that consciousness transcends individual boundaries. The faith’s emphasis on consultation, collaboration, and community building further illustrates how collective awareness can lead to transformative societal change, reinforcing the belief that consciousness is a powerful force in shaping existence.
