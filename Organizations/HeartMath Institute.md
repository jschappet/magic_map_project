## Introduction
The HeartMath Institute is a research and educational organization dedicated to studying the connection between heart coherence, emotional well-being, and human potential. Founded in 1991, the Institute focuses on the scientific understanding of the heart's role in our emotional and physiological health, offering tools and techniques to enhance personal and collective well-being. The Institute's research emphasizes the heart's intelligence and its influence on our thoughts, emotions, and overall consciousness.

## Relevance
Heart coherence supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by demonstrating how emotional states can influence physiological processes and vice versa. The HeartMath Institute's research reveals that when individuals achieve heart coherence, they not only improve their emotional health but also enhance their capacity for awareness and intention. This state of coherence fosters a deeper connection to oneself and others, suggesting that consciousness is not merely a product of the brain but an expansive, interconnected phenomenon. Key findings indicate that heart coherence can lead to greater intuitive insights, improved decision-making, and a heightened sense of purpose, reinforcing the idea that our awareness and intentions can shape our experiences and interactions with the world around us.
