## Introduction
Dorothy Jane Roberts is a prominent scholar and author known for her work in law, sociology, and race studies. Her research focuses on the intersections of race, gender, and class, particularly in relation to issues of reproductive justice and the legal system. Through her influential writings and public speaking, Roberts has highlighted the systemic inequalities that affect marginalized communities, advocating for social change and justice.

## Relevance
Roberts' work supports the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality by emphasizing the importance of awareness and intention in shaping societal structures and individual lives. Her exploration of how laws and social norms influence the lived experiences of women of color illustrates the interconnectedness of personal and collective consciousness. By advocating for reproductive justice, she highlights the necessity of collective awareness in addressing systemic injustices and fostering a more equitable society. Her findings suggest that consciousness is not merely an individual phenomenon but a shared experience that can drive social transformation through intentional action and awareness.
