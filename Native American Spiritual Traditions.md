## Introduction
Native American spiritual traditions encompass a wide range of beliefs, practices, and cultural expressions that have developed over thousands of years among various Indigenous peoples of North America. These traditions are deeply rooted in a profound connection to nature, ancestors, and the cosmos, often emphasizing the importance of community, harmony, and respect for all living beings. Spiritual practices may include rituals, ceremonies, storytelling, and the use of sacred objects, all aimed at fostering a sense of unity with the universe and the spirit world. 

## Relevance
Native American spiritual traditions support the view of consciousness as a fundamental, non-local, and interconnected basis of reality. Many Indigenous beliefs emphasize the idea that all beings, both seen and unseen, are interconnected through a web of life. This perspective aligns with modern understandings of consciousness that suggest awareness and intention are not merely products of individual minds but part of a larger universal consciousness. Practices such as prayer, meditation, and rituals are seen as ways to engage with this consciousness, shaping existence through intention and fostering a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all life. The emphasis on living in harmony with nature and honoring the spirit in all things reflects a profound understanding of the relational nature of reality.
